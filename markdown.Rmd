Target Markdown, available in `targets` > 0.6.0, is a powerful R Markdown interface for reproducible analysis pipelines. With Target Markdown, you can define a fully scalable pipeline from within one or more R Markdown reports, anything from a single report to a whole `bookdown` or `workflowr` project. You get the best of both worlds: the human readable narrative of literate programming, and the sophisticated caching and dependency management systems of `targets`.

## Access

This chapter's [example Target Markdown document](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/blob/main/inst/rmarkdown/templates/targets/skeleton/skeleton.Rmd) is itself a tutorial and a simplified version of the chapter. There are two convenient ways to access the file:

1. The [`use_targets()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/use_targets.html) function.
2. The [RStudio R Markdown template system] https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/rmarkdown_templates.html.

For (2), in the RStudio IDE, select a new R Markdown document in the New File dropdown menu in the upper left-hand corner of the window.

Then, select the Target Markdown template and click OK to open a copy of the report for editing.

## Purpose

Target Markdown has two primary objectives:

1. Interactively explore, prototype, and test the components of a `targets` pipeline using the R Markdown [notebook interface](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html).
2. Set up a `targets` pipeline using convenient R Markdown code chunks.

Target Markdown supports a special `{targets}` [language engine](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/other-languages.html) with an interactive mode for (1) and a non-interactive mode for (2). By default, the mode is interactive in the [notebook interface](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html) and non-interactive when you knit/render the whole document.^[In `targets` version 0.6.0, the mode is interactive if `interactive()` is `TRUE`. In subsequent versions, the mode is interactive if `!isTRUE(getOption("knitr.in.progress"))` is `TRUE`.]. You can set the mode using the `tar_interactive` chunk option.

## Example

The following example is based on the minimal `targets` project at https://github.com/wlandau/targets-minimal/. We process the base `airquality` dataset, fit a model, and display a histogram of ozone concentration.

## Packages

This example requires several R packages, and `targets` must be version 0.6.0 or above.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# R console
install.packages(c("biglm", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "readr", "targets", "tidyr"))
```

## Setup

First, load `targets` to activate the specialized `knitr` engine for Target Markdown.

````
`r ''````{r}
library(targets)
```
````

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
library(targets)
```

Non-interactive Target Markdown writes scripts to a special `_targets_r/` directory to define individual targets and global objects. In order to keep your target definitions up to date, it is recommended to remove `_targets_r/` at the beginning of the R Markdown document(s) in order to clear out superfluous targets and globals from a previous version. `tar_unscript()` is a convenient way to do this.

````
`r ''````{r}
tar_unscript()
```
````

## Globals

As usual, your targets depend on custom functions, global objects, and `tar_option_set()` options you define before the pipeline begins. Define these globals using the `{targets}` engine with `tar_globals = TRUE` chunk option. 

````
`r ''````{targets some-globals, tar_globals = TRUE, tar_interactive = TRUE}
options(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE)
tar_option_set(packages = c("biglm", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "readr", "tidyr"))
create_plot <- function(data) {
  ggplot(data) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = Ozone), bins = 12) +
    theme_gray(24)
}
```
````

In interactive mode, the chunk simply runs the R code in the `tar_option_get("envir")` environment (usually the global environment) and displays a message:

```{targets some-globals, tar_globals = TRUE, tar_interactive = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
options(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE)
tar_option_set(packages = c("biglm", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "readr", "tidyr"))
create_plot <- function(data) {
  ggplot(data) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = Ozone), bins = 12) +
    theme_gray(24)
}
```

Here is the same chunk in non-interactive mode. Normally, there is no need to duplicate chunks like this, but we do so here in order to demonstrate both modes.

````
`r ''````{targets chunk-name, tar_globals = TRUE, tar_interactive = FALSE}
options(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE)
tar_option_set(packages = c("biglm", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "readr", "tidyr"))
create_plot <- function(data) {
  ggplot(data) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = Ozone), bins = 12) +
    theme_gray(24)
}
```
````

In non-interactive mode, the chunk establishes a common `_targets.R` file and writes the R code to a script in `_targets_r/globals/`, and displays an informative message:^[The `_targets.R` file from Target Markdown never changes from chunk to chunk or report to report, so you can spread your work over multiple reports without worrying about aligning `_targets.R` scripts. Just be sure all your chunk names are unique across all the reports of a project, or you set the `tar_name` chunk option to specify base names of script file paths.]

```{targets chunk-name, tar_globals = TRUE, tar_interactive = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
options(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE)
tar_option_set(packages = c("biglm", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "readr", "tidyr"))
create_plot <- function(data) {
  ggplot(data) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = Ozone), bins = 12) +
    theme_gray(24)
}
```

It is good practice to assign explicit chunk labels or set the `tar_name` chunk option on a chunk-by-chunk basis. Each chunk writes code to a script path that depends on the name, and all script paths need to be unique.^[In addition, for for `bookdown` projects, chunk labels should only use alphanumeric characters and dashes.]

## Targets

To define targets of the pipeline, use the `{targets}` language engine with the `tar_globals` chunk option equal `FALSE` or `NULL` (default). The return value of the chunk must be a target object or a list of target objects, created by `tar_target()` or a similar function.

Below, we define a target to establish the air quality dataset in the pipeline.

````
`r ''````{targets raw-data, tar_interactive = TRUE}
tar_target(raw_data, airquality)
```
````

If you run this chunk in interactive mode, the target's R command runs, the engine tests if the output can be saved and loaded from disk correctly, and then the return value gets assigned to the `tar_option_get("envir")` environment (usually the global environment). 

```{targets raw-data, tar_interactive = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
tar_target(raw_data, airquality)
```

In the process, some temporary files are created and destroyed, but your local file space will remain untouched (barring any custom side effects in your custom code).

After you run a target in interactive mode, the return value is available in memory, and you can write an ordinary R code chunk to read it.

````
`r ''````{r}
head(raw_data)
```
````

The output is the same as what `tar_read(raw_data)` would show after a serious pipeline run.

```{r}
head(raw_data)
```

For demonstration purposes, here is the `raw_data` target code chunk in non-interactive mode.

````
`r ''````{targets chunk-name-with-target, tar_interactive = FALSE}
tar_target(raw_data, airquality)
```
````

In non-interactive mode, the `{targets}` engine does not actually run any targets. Instead, it establishes a common `_targets.R` and writes the code to a script in `_targets_r/targets/`.

```{targets chunk-name-with-target, tar_interactive = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
tar_target(raw_data, airquality)
```

Next, we define more targets to process the raw data and plot a histogram. Only the returned value of the chunk code actually becomes part of the pipeline, so if you define multiple targets in a single chunk, be sure to wrap them all in a list.

````
`r ''````{targets downstream-targets}
list(
  tar_target(data, raw_data %>% filter(!is.na(Ozone))),
  tar_target(hist, create_plot(data))
)
```
````

In non-interactive mode, the whole target list gets written to a single script.

```{targets downstream-targets, echo = FALSE, tar_interactive = FALSE}
list(
  tar_target(data, raw_data %>% filter(!is.na(Ozone))),
  tar_target(hist, create_plot(data))
)
```

Lastly, we define a target to fit a model to the data. For simple targets like this one, we can use convenient shorthand to convert the code in a chunk into a valid target. Simply set the `tar_simple` chunk option to `TRUE`.

````
`r ''````{targets fit, tar_simple = TRUE}
analysis_data <- data
biglm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, analysis_data)
```
````

When the chunk is preprocessed, chunk label (or the `tar_name` chunk option if you set it) becomes the target name, and the chunk code becomes the target command. All other arguments of `tar_target()` remain at their default values (configurable with `tar_option_set()` in a `tar_globals = TRUE` chunk). The output in the rendered R Markdown document reflects this preprocessing.

```{targets fit, tar_simple = TRUE, echo = TRUE, tar_interactive = FALSE}
biglm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data)
```

## Pipeline

If you ran all the `{targets}` chunks in non-interactive mode (i.e. pipeline construction mode), then the target script file and helper scripts should all be established, and you are ready to run the pipeline in with `tar_make()` in an ordinary `{r}` code chunk. This time, the output is written to persistent storage at the project root.

````
`r ''````{r}
tar_make()
```
````

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
tar_make()
```

## Output

You can retrieve results from the `_targets/` data store using `tar_read()` or `tar_load()`.

````
`r ''````{r}
library(biglm)
tar_read(fit)
```
````

```{r readbiglmfit, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
library(biglm)
tar_read(fit)
```

````
`r ''````{r}
tar_read(hist)
```
````

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
tar_read(hist)
```

The `targets` dependency graph helps your readers understand the steps of your pipeline at a high level.

````
`r ''````{r}
tar_visnetwork()
```
````

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
tar_visnetwork()
```

At this point, you can go back and run `{targets}` chunks in interactive mode without interfering with the code or data of the non-interactive pipeline.

## Chunk options

* `tar_globals`: Logical of length 1, whether to define globals or targets. If `TRUE`, the chunk code defines functions, objects, and options common to all the targets. If `FALSE` or `NULL` (default), then the chunk returns formal targets for the pipeline.
* `tar_interactive`: Logical of length 1 to choose whether to run the chunk in interactive mode or non-interactive mode.
* `tar_name`: name to use for writing helper script files (e.g.  _targets_r/targets/target_script.R) and specifying target names if the tar_simple chunk option is TRUE. All helper scripts and target names must have unique names, so please do not set this option globally with knitr::opts_chunk$set().
* `tar_script`: Character of length 1, where to write the target script file in non-interactive mode. Most users can skip this option and stick with the default `_targets.R` script path. Helper script files are always written next to the target script in a folder with an `"_r"` suffix. The `tar_script` path must either be absolute or be relative to the project root (where you call `tar_make()` or similar). If not specified, the target script path defaults to `tar_config_get("script")` (default: `_targets.R`; helpers default: `_targets_r/`). When you run `tar_make()` etc. with a non-default target script, you must select the correct target script file either with the `script` argument or with `tar_config_set(script = ...)`. The function will `source()` the script file from the current working directory (i.e. with `chdir = FALSE` in `source()`).
* `tar_simple`: Logical of length 1. Set to `TRUE` to define a single target with a simplified interface. In code chunks with `tar_simple` equal to `TRUE`, the chunk label (or the `tar_name` chunk option if you set it) becomes the name, and the chunk code becomes the command. In other words, a code chunk with label `targetname` and command `mycommand()` automatically gets converted to `tar_target(name = targetname, command = mycommand())`. All other arguments of `tar_target()` remain at their default values (configurable with `tar_option_set()` in a `tar_globals = TRUE` chunk).
