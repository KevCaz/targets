This repository is the targets R package user manual. It contains in-depth discussion and walkthroughs of the main features of 'targets' and advice about best practices. The goal is to introduce new users to 'targets' and instill a thorough understanding of what it does, how it works, and when to use it. The manual is implemented as a typical 'bookdown' project with a single '_bookdown.yml' file at the top level and one R Markdown source file for each chapter. End users are encouraged to read the rendered output at <https://wlandau.github.io/targets-manual>.
