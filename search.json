With targets, you can maintain a reproducible workflow without repeating yourself. targets learns how your pipeline fits together, skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, runs only the necessary computation, supports implicit parallel computing, abstracts files as R objects, and shows tangible evidence that the results match the underlying code and data."

When all targets are up to date, this is evidence that the results match the underlying code and data, which helps us trust the results and confirm the computation is reproducible."

Ours looks like this:\n\n# _targets.R file\nlibrary(targets)\nsource(\"R/functions.R\")\ntar_option_set(packages = c(\"readr\", \"dplyr\", \"ggplot2\"))\nlist(\n  tar_target(file, \"data.csv\", format = \"file\"),\n  tar_target(data, get_data(file)),\n  tar_target(model, fit_model(data)),\n  tar_target(plot, plot_model(model, data))\n)\n\nAll target script files have these requirements.\n\nLoad the packages needet to define the pipeline, e.g. targets itself.2\nUse tar_option_set() to declare the packages that the targets themselves need, as well as other settings such as the default storage format.\nLoad your custom functions and small input objects into the R session: in our case, with source(\"R/functions.R\").\nWrite the pipeline at the bottom of _targets.R. A pipeline is a list of target objects, which you can create with tar_target(). Each target is a step of the analysis.

This memory cleanup phase happens once per target.\nAs with everything performance-related, there is a cost. With transient memory and garbage collection, the pipeline reads data from storage far more often. These data reads take additional time, and if you use cloud storage, they could incur additional monetary charges. In addition, garbage collection is usually a slow operation, and repeated garbage collections could slow down a pipeline with thousands of targets.

This happens because each target needs to check its data, decide whether it needs to rerun, load its upstream dependencies from memory if applicable, and store its data after running. The overhead of these actions adds up.\nTo reduce overhead, consider dividing up the work into a smaller number of targets. Each target is a cached operation, and not all steps of the pipeline needs to be cached at a perfect level of granularity. See the sections on what a target should do and how much a target should do.\n\n4.6.1 Batching\nSimulation studies and other iterative stochastic pipelines may need to run thousands of independent random replications. For these pipelines, consider batching to reduce the number of targets while preserving the number of replications. In batching, each batch is a dynamic branch target that performs a subset of the replications. For 1000 replications, you might want 40 batches of 25 replications each, 10 batches with 100 replications each, or a different balance depending on the use case. Functions tarchetypes::tar_rep(), tarchetypes::tar_map_rep(), and stantargets::tar_stan_mcmc_rep_summary() are examples of target factories that set up the batching structure without needing to understand dynamic branching."

This hash fingerprints the deparsed function (body and arguments) together with the hashes of all global functions and objects called that function. So if the function’s body, arguments, or dependencies change nontrivially, that change will be detected.\nThis hashing system is not perfect. For example, functions created by Rcpp::cppFunction() do not show the state of the underlying C++ code. As a workaround, you can use a wrapper that inserts the C++ code into the R function body so targets can track it for meaningful changes.\n\ncpp_function <- function(code) {\n  out <- Rcpp::cppFunction(code)\n  body(out) <- rlang::call2(\"{\", code, body(out))\n  out\n}\n\nyour_function <- cpp_function(\n  \"int your_function(int x, int y, int z) {\n     int sum = x + y + z;\n     return sum;\n   }\"\n)\n\nFunctions produced by Vectorize() and purrr::safely() suffer similar issues because the actual function code is in the closure of the function instead of the body.

Usually, local package libraries do not need to change very often, and it is best to maintain a reproducible project library using renv.\nHowever, if you are developing a package alongside a targets pipeline that uses it, you may wish to invalidate certain targets as you make changes to your package. For example, if you are working on a novel statistical method, it is good practice to implement the method itself as an R package and perform the computation for the research paper in one or more targets pipelines.\nTo track the contents of packages package1 and package2, you must\n\nFully install these packages with install.packages() or equivalent. devtools::load_all() is insufficient because it does not make the packages available to parallel workers.\nWrite the following in your target script file (default: _targets.R):\n\n\n# _targets.R\nlibrary(targets)\ntar_option_set(\n  packages = c(\"package1\", \"package2\", ...), # `...` is for other packages.\n  imports = c(\"package1\", \"package2\")\n)\nlist(\n  tar_target(name = output, command = function_from_package1())\n)\n\npackages = c(\"package1\", \"package2\", ...) tells targets to call library(package1), library(package2), etc. before running each target. imports = c(\"package1\", \"package2\") tells targets to dive into the environments of package1 and package2 and reproducibly track all the objects and datasets as if they were part of the global environment. For example, if you define a function function_from_package1() in package1, then you should see a function node for function_from_package1() in the graph produced by tar_visnetwork(targets_only = FALSE), and targets downstream of function_from_package1() will invalidate if you install an update to package1 with a new version of function_from_package1(). The next time you call tar_make(), those invalidated targets will automatically rerun.\nOne limitation is that entire namespaced calls like package1::function_from_package1() are not registered in the dependency graph because of the limitations of the static code analysis capabilities of targets (powered by codetools::findGlobals()). tar_target(name = output, command = function_from_package1()) has a dependency function_from_package1(), but tar_target(name = output, command = package1::function_from_package1()) does not have a dependency package1::function_from_package1().

For more serious projects, the file system may expand to look something like this:\n\n├── .git/\n├── .Rprofile\n├── .Renviron\n├── renv/\n├── index.Rmd\n├── _targets/\n├── _targets.R\n├── _targets.yaml\n├── R/\n├──── functions_data.R\n├──── functions_analysis.R\n├──── functions_visualization.R\n├── data/\n└──── input_data.csv\n\nSome of these files are optional, and they have the following roles.\n\n.git/: a folder automatically created by Git for version control purposes.\n.Rprofile: a text file automatically created by renv to automatically load the project library when you start R at the project root folder. You may wish to add other global configuration here, e.g. declare package precedence using the conflicted package.\n.Renviron: a text file of key-value pairs defining project-level environment variables, e.g. API keys and package settings. See Sys.getenv() for more information on environment variables and how to work with them in R.\n\nindex.Rmd: Target Markdown report source file to define the pipeline.\n_targets/: the data store where tar_make() and similar functions write target storage and metadata when they run the pipeline.\n_targets.R: the target script file. All targets pipelines must have a target script file that returns a target list at the end. If you use Target Markdown (e.g. index.Rmd above) then the target script will be written automatically. Otherwise, you may write it by hand. Unless you apply the custom configuration described later in this chapter, the target script file will always be called _targets.R and live at the project root folder.\n_targets.yaml: a YAML file to set default arguments to critical functions like tar_make(). As described below, you can access and modify this file with functions tar_config_get(), tar_config_set(), and tar_config_unset(). targets will attempt to look for _targets.yaml unless you set a different path in the TAR_CONFIG environment variable.\nR/: directory of scripts containing custom user-defined R code. Most of the code will likely contain custom functions you write to support your targets. You can load these functions with source(\"R/function_script.R\") or eval(parse(text = \"R/function_script.R\"), either in a tar_globals = TRUE code chunk in Target Markdown or directly in _targets.R if you are not using Target Markdown.\ndata/: directory of local input data files. As described in the files chapter, it is good practice to track input files using format = \"file\" in tar_target() and then reference those file targets in downstream targets that directly depend on those files."

    "text": "8.3 Multiple projects\nIt is generally good practice to give each project its own unique folder with one targets pipeline, one renv library for package management, and one Git/GitHub repository for code version control. However, sometimes it is reasonable to maintain multiple pipelines within a project: for example, if different pipelines have similar research goals and share the same code base of custom user-defined functions. This section explains how to maintain and navigate such a collection of overlapping projects.\nThe functionality below assumes you have targets version 0.7.0.9001 or higher, which you may need to install from GitHub.\n\nremotes::install_github(\"ropensci/targets\")\n\n\n8.3.1 Create each project.\nTo begin, write the shared code base of custom user-defined functions in R/, and write one targets pipeline per project. For convenience, we will directly write to the targets script files, but the principles generalize to Target Markdown. The file structure looks something like this:\n\n├── _targets.yaml\n├── script_a.R\n├── script_b.R\n├── R/\n├──── functions_data.R\n├──── functions_analysis.R\n├──── functions_visualization.R\n...\n\nAll projects share the same functions defined in the scripts in R/, and each project uses a different target script and data store. script_a.R defines the targets for project A.\n\n# script_a.R\nlibrary(targets)\nsource(\"R/functions_data.R\")\nsource(\"R/functions_analysis.R\")\nsource(\"R/functions_visualization.R\")\ntar_option_set(packages = \"tidyverse\")\nlist(\n  tar_target(target_abc, f(..)),\n  tar_target(tarbet_xyz, g(...))\n)\n\nLikewise, script_b.R defines the targets for project B.\n\n# script_b.R\nlibrary(targets)\nsource(\"R/functions_data.R\")\nsource(\"R/functions_analysis.R\")\nsource(\"R/functions_visualization.R\")\ntar_option_set(packages = \"tidyverse\")\nlist(\n  tar_target(target_123, f(...)),\n  tar_target(target_456, h(...))\n)\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Configure each project.\nTo establish a different store and script per project, write a top-level _targets.yaml configuration to specify these paths explicitly. You can do this from R with tar_config_set().\n\ntar_config_set(script = \"script_a.R\", store = \"store_a\", project = \"project_a\")\ntar_config_set(script = \"script_b.R\", store = \"store_b\", project = \"project_b\")\n\nThe R code above writes the following _targets.yaml configuration file.\nproject_a:\n  store: store_a\n  script: script_a.R\nproject_b:\n  store: store_b\n  script: script_b.R\n\n\n8.3.3 Run each project\nTo run each project, run tar_make() with the correct target script and data store. To select the correct script and store, set the TAR_PROJECT environment variable to the correct project name. that way, tar_config_get() automatically supplies the correct script and store arguments to tar_make().\n\nSys.setenv(TAR_PROJECT = \"project_a\")\ntar_make()\ntar_read(target_abc)\nSys.setenv(TAR_PROJECT = \"project_b\")\ntar_make()\ntar_read(target_123)\n\nAlternatively, you can manually select the appropriate script and store for each project. This is a less convenient approach, but if you do it, you do not need to set the TAR_PROJECT environment variable or rely on _targets.yaml.\n\ntar_make(script = \"script_a.R\", store = \"store_a\")\ntar_read(target_abc, sctore = \"store_a\")\ntar_make(script = \"script_b.R\", store = \"store_b\")\ntar_read(target_abc, sctore = \"store_b\")"

A higher-performant solution for large data is to treat the file in project A’s data store as an input file target in project B. This second approach requires an understanding of the data store and an awareness of which targets are stored locally and which are stored on the cloud. For a target with repository = \"local\", you can begin from the file store_a/objects/target_from_project_a. Otherwise, the target’s file exists on the cloud (AWS or GCP) and you may need to access the target as a URL in a target with format = \"url\".\n\n# script_b.R\nlibrary(targets)\nsource(\"R/functions_data.R\")\nsource(\"R/functions_analysis.R\")\nsource(\"R/functions_visualization.R\")\ntar_option_set(packages = \"tidyverse\")\nlist(\n  tar_target(file_from_project_a, \"store_a/objects/target_name\", format = \"file\"),\n  tar_target(data_from_project_a, readRDS(file_from_project_a)), # Assumes format = \"rds\" in project A.\n  tar_target(new_target, analyze_data(data_from_project_a)),\n  ...\n)"

Those return values, along with descriptive metadata, are saved to persistent storage so your pipeline stays up to date even after you exit R. By default, this persistent storage is a special _targets/ folder created in your working directory by tar_make(). The files in the local data store are organized as follows.\n_targets/ # Can be customized with tar_config_set().\n├── meta/\n├────── meta\n├────── process\n├────── progress\n├── objects/\n├────── target1 \n├────── target2\n├────── branching_target_c7bcb4bd\n├────── branching_target_285fb6a9\n├────── branching_target_874ca381\n├── scratch/ # tar_make() deletes this folder after it finishes.\n└── user/ # gittargets users can put custom files here for data version control.\nThe two most important components are:\n\n_targets/meta/meta, a flat text file with descriptive metadata about each target, including warning, errors, and runtime. You can read this data as a data frame tar_meta(). and\n_targets/objects/, a folder with one data file per target.\n\nIf your pipeline has a target defined by tar_target(name = x, command = 1 + 1, format = \"rds\", repository = \"local\"), during tar_make():\n\nThe target runs and returns a value of 2.\nThe return value 2 is saved as an RDS file to _targets/objects/x.

You can read that metadata with tar_meta(x). Notably, tar_meta(x)$data contains the hash of file _targets/objects/x. This has helps the next tar_make() decide whether to rerun target x.\n\nThe format argument of tar_target() (and tar_option_set()) controls how tar_make() saves the return value. The default is \"rds\", which uses saveRDS(), and there are more efficient formats such as \"qs\" and \"feather\". Some of these formats require external packages.

That way, tar_make() will automatically rerun the appropriate targets if these files change. To watch one of more files, create a target that\n\nHas format = \"file\" in tar_target(), and\nReturns a character vector of local files and/or directories.\n\nThe example sketch of a pipeline below follows this pattern.\n\n# _targets.R\nlibrary(targets)\ncreate_output <- function(file) {\n  data <- read.csv(file)\n  output <- head(data)\n  write.csv(output, \"output.csv\")\n  \"output.csv\"\n}\nlist(\n  tar_target(name = input, command = \"data.csv\", format = \"file\"),\n  tar_target(name = output, command = create_output(input), format = \"file\")\n)\n\nWe assume a file called data.csv exists prior to running the pipeline. When tar_make() runs the first time, target input runs and returns the value \"data.csv\". Because format is \"file\", no extra file is saved to _targets/meta/objects/. Instead, \"data.csv\" gets hashed, and the hash is stored in the metadata. Then, target output runs, creates the file \"output.csv\", and that file gets processed the same way.\nTarget output depends on target input because the command of target output mentions the symbol input. (Verify with tar_visnetwork().) That way, output does not run until input is finished, and output reruns if the hash of input changes. It is good practice to write target symbols instead of literal input paths to ensure the proper dependency relationships. In this case, if output were written with the literal input path as tar_target(name = output, command = create_output(\"data.csv\"), format = \"file\"), then the dependency relationship would break, and output would not rerun if input changed.\nThe mechanism of format = \"file\" applies equally to input files and output files. In fact, a target can track both input and output files at the same time. This is part of how tar_render() works. As discussed in the R Markdown chapter, tar_render() takes an R Markdown source file as input, write a rendered report file as output, and returns a character vector with the paths to both files."

For big data workflows where not all data can fit into RAM, it is wiser to set memory = \"transient\" and garbage_collection = TRUE in tar_target() (and tar_option_set()). That way, the target return value is removed from memory at the earliest opportunity. The next time the target value is needed, it is reread from storage again, and then removed from memory as soon as possible. Reading a big dataset from storage can take time, which may slow down some pipelines, but it may be worth the extra time to make sure memory usage stays within reasonable limits."

Using arguments repository and resources of tar_target() (and tar_option_set()), you can send the return value to the cloud instead of a local file in _targets/objects/. The repository argument identifies the cloud service of choice: \"aws\" for Amazon Web Service (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3), and \"gcp\" for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Google Cloud Storage (GCS). Each platform requires different steps to configure, but there usage in targets is almost exactly the same.\n\n9.4.1 Cost\nCloud services cost money. The more resources you use, the more you owe. Resources not only include the data you store, but also the HTTP requests that tar_make() uses to check if a target exists and is up to date. So cost increases with the number of cloud targets and the frequency that you run them. Please proactively monitor usage in the AWS or GCP web console and rethink your strategy if usage is too high. For example, you might consider running the pipeline locally and then sycning the data store to a bucket only at infrequent strategic milestones.\n\n\n9.4.2 AWS setup\n\nSign up for a free tier account at https://aws.amazon.com/free.\nFollow these instructions to practice using Simple Storage Service (S3) through the web console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.\nInstall the paws R package with install.packages(\"paws\").\nFollow the credentials section of the paws README to connect paws to your AWS account. You will set special environment variables in your user-level .Renviron file. Example:\n\n\n# Example .Renviron file\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\nAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY\nAWS_REGION=us-east-1 # The paws package and thus targets >= 0.8.1.9000 use this.\nAWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 # For back compatibility with targets <= 0.8.1.\n\n\nRestart your R session and create an S3 buckets to store target data. You can do this either in the AWS S3 web console or the following code.\n\n\nlibrary(paws)\ns3 <- s3()\ns3$create_bucket(Bucket = \"my-test-bucket-25edb4956460647d\")\n\n\n\n9.4.3 GCP setup\n\nActivate a Google Cloud Platform account at https://cloud.google.com/.\nFollow the instructions at https://code.markedmondson.me/googleCloudRunner/articles/setup-gcp.html to set up your GCP account to use locally with R. The video is friendly and helpful.\nIn your .Renviron file, set the GCS_AUTH_FILE environment variable to the same value as GCE_AUTH_FILE from step (2).\nCreate a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket to store target data. You can do this either with the GCP GCS web dashboard or the following code.\n\n\ngoogleCloudStorageR::gcs_create_bucket(\n  bucket = \"my-test-bucket-25edb4956460647d\",\n  projectId = Sys.getenv(\"GCE_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID\")\n)\n\n\nVerify that your Google Cloud account and R installation of GoogleCloudStorageR are working properly. targets uses the GoogleCloudStorageR package internally, and you can make sure it is working by testing a simple upload.\n\n\n\n9.4.4 Usage\nThe following is an example pipeline that sends targets to an AWS S3 bucket. Usage in GCP is almost exactly the same.\n\n# Example _targets.R file:\nlibrary(targets)\ntar_option_set(\n  resources = tar_resources(\n    aws = tar_resources_aws(bucket = \"my-test-bucket-25edb4956460647d\")\n  )\n)\nwrite_mean <- function(data) {\n  tmp <- tempfile()\n  writeLines(as.character(mean(data)), tmp)\n  tmp\n}\nlist(\n  tar_target(\n    data,\n    rnorm(5),\n    format = \"qs\", # Set format = \"aws_qs\" in targets <= 0.10.0.\n    repository = \"aws\" # Set to \"gcp\" for Google Cloud Platform.\n  ), \n  tar_target(\n    mean_file,\n    write_mean(data),\n    format = \"file\", # Set format = \"aws_file\" in targets <= 0.10.0.\n    repository = \"aws\" # Set to \"gcp\" for Google Cloud Platform.\n  )\n)\n\nWhen you run the pipeline above with tar_make(), your local R session computes rnorm(5), saves it to a temporary qs file on disk, and then uploads it to a file called _targets/objects/data on your S3 bucket. Likewise for mean_file, but because the format is \"file\" and the repository is \"aws\", you are responsible for supplying the path to the file that gets uploaded to _targets/objects/mean_file.\nformat = \"file\" works differently for cloud storage than local storage. Here, it is assumed that the command of the target writes a single file, and then targets uploads this file to the cloud and deletes the local copy. At that point, the copy in the cloud is tracked for changes, and the local copy does not exist.\n\ntar_make()\n#> ● run target data\n#> ● run target mean_file\n#> ● end pipeline\n\nAnd of course, your targets stay up to date if you make no changes.\n\ntar_make()\n#> ✓ skip target data\n#> ✓ skip target mean_file\n#> ✓ skip pipeline\n\nIf you log into https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3, you should see objects _targets/objects/data and _targets/objects/mean_file in your bucket. To download this data locally, use tar_read() and tar_load() like before. These functions download the data from the bucket and load it into R.\n\ntar_read(data)\n#> [1] -0.74654607 -0.59593497 -1.57229983  0.40915323  0.02579023\n\nThe \"file\" format behaves differently on the cloud. tar_read() and tar_load() download the object to a local path (where the target saved it locally before it was uploaded) and return the path so you can process it yourself.1\n\ntar_load(mean_file)\nmean_file\n#> [1] \"_targets/scratch/mean_fileff086e70876d\"\n\n\nreadLines(mean_file)\n#> [1] \"-0.495967480886693\"\n\nWhen you are done with these temporary files and the pipeline is no longer running, you can safely remove everything in _targets/scratch/.\n\nunlink(\"_targets/scratch/\", recursive = TRUE) # tar_destroy(destroy = \"scratch\")\n\n\n\n9.4.5 Data version control\nAmazon and Google support versioned buckets. If your bucket has versioning turned on, then every version of every target will be stored,2, and the target metadata will contain the version ID (verify with tar_meta(your_target, path)$path). That way, if you roll back _targets/meta/meta to a prior version, then tar_read(your_target) will read a prior target. And if you roll back the metadata and the code together, then your pipeline will journey back in time while stay up to date (old code synced with old data). Rolling back is possible if you use Git/GitHub and commit your R code files and _targets/meta/meta to the repository. An alternative cloudless versioning solution is gittargets, a package that snapshots the local data store and syncs with an existing code repository."

It removes the _targets/ folder (or optionally a subfolder in _targets/) and all the cloud targets mentioned in the metadata. Use it if you intend to start the pipeline from scratch without any trace of a previous run.\ntar_prune() deletes the data and metadata of all the targets no longer present in your current target script file (default: _targets.R). This is useful if you recently worked through multiple changes to your project and are now trying to discard irrelevant data while keeping the results that still matter.\ntar_delete() is more selective than tar_destroy() and tar_prune(). It removes the individual data files of a given set of targets from _targets/objects/ and cloud buckets while leaving the metadata in _targets/meta/meta alone. If you have a small number of data-heavy targets you need to discard to conserve storage, this function can help.\ntar_invalidate() is the opposite of tar_delete(): for the selected targets, it deletes the metadata in _targets/meta/meta and does not delete the return values. After invalidation, you will still be able to locate the data files with tar_path() and manually salvage them in an emergency. However, tar_load() and tar_read() will not be able to read the data into R, and subsequent calls to tar_make() will attempt to rebuild those targets."

The document(s) have little to no computation of their own, and they make heavy use of tar_read() and tar_load() to leverage output from other targets.\nAs an example, let us extend the walkthrough example chapter with the following R Markdown source file report.Rmd.\n\nThis document depends on targets fit and hist. If we previously ran the pipeline and the data store _targets/ exists, then tar_read() and tar_load() will read those targets and show them in the rendered HTML output report.html.\n\nWith the tar_render() function in tarchetypes, we can go a step further and include report.Rmd as a target in the pipeline. This new targets re-renders report.Rmd whenever fit or hist changes, which means tar_make() brings the output file report.html up to date.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tarchetypes)\ntarget <- tar_render(report, \"report.Rmd\") # Just defines a target object.\ntarget$command$expr[[1]]\n#> tarchetypes::tar_render_run(path = \"report.Rmd\", args = list(input = \"report.Rmd\", \n#>     knit_root_dir = getwd(), quiet = TRUE), deps = list(fit, \n#>     hist))\n\ntar_render() is like tar_target(), except that you supply the file path to the R Markdown report instead of an R command. Here it is at the bottom of the example _targets.R file below:\n\n# _targets.R\nlibrary(targets)\nlibrary(tarchetypes)\nsource(\"R/functions.R\")\nlist(\n  tar_target(\n    raw_data_file,\n    \"data/raw_data.csv\",\n    format = \"file\"\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    raw_data,\n    read_csv(raw_data_file, col_types = cols())\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    data,\n    raw_data %>%\n      mutate(Ozone = replace_na(Ozone, mean(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)))\n  ),\n  tar_target(hist, create_plot(data)),\n  tar_target(fit, biglm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data)),\n  tar_render(report, \"report.Rmd\") # Here is our call to tar_render().\n)\n\nWhen we visualize the pipeline, we see that our report target depends on targets fit and hist. tar_render() automatically detects these upstream dependencies by statically analyzing report.Rmd for calls to tar_load() and tar_read().\n\n# R console\ntar_visnetwork()\n\n\n\n\n10.1.2 Quarto targets\ntarchetypes >= 0.6.0.9000 supports a tar_quarto() function, which is like tar_render(), but for Quarto. For an individual source document, tar_quarto() works exactly the same way as tar_render(). However, tar_quarto() is more powerful: you can supply the path to an entire Quarto project, such as a book, blog, or website. tar_quarto() looks for target dependencies in all the source documents (e.g. listed in _quarto.yml), and it tracks the important files in the project for changes (run tar_quarto_files() to see which ones).\n\n\n10.1.3 Parameterized documents\ntarchetypes functions make it straightforward to use parameterized R Markdown and parameterized Quarto in a targets pipeline. The next two subsections walk through the major use cases.\n\n\n10.1.4 Single parameter set\nIn this scenario, the pipeline renders your parameterized report one time using a single set of parameters. These parameters can be upstream targets, global objects, or fixed values. Simply pass a params argument to tar_render() or an execute_params argument to tar_quarto(). Example:\n\n# _targets.R\nlibrary(targets)\nlibrary(tarchetypes)\nlist(\n  tar_target(data, data.frame(x = seq_len(26), y = letters))\n  tar_quarto(report, \"report.qmd\", execute_params = list(your_param = data))\n)\n\nInternally, the report target runs:\n\n# R console\nquarto::quarto_render(\"report.qmd\", params = list(your_param = your_target))\n\nwhere report.qmd looks like this:\n\nSee tar_quarto() examples and tar_render() examples for more.\n\n\n10.1.5 Multiple parameter sets\nIn this scenario, you still have a single report, but you render it multiple times over a grid of parameters. This time, use tar_quarto_rep() or tar_render_rep(). Each of these functions takes as input a grid of parameters with one column per parameter and one row per parameter set, where each parameter set is used to render an instance of the document. In other words, the number of rows in the parameter grid is the number of output documents you will produce. Below is an example _targets.R file using tar_render_rep(). Usage with tar_quarto_rep() is the same1.\n\n# _targets.R\nlibrary(targets)\nlibrary(tarchetypes)\ntar_option_set(packages = \"tibble\")\nlist(\n  tar_target(x, \"value_of_x\"),\n  tar_render_rep(\n    report,\n    \"report.Rmd\",\n    params = tibble(\n      par = c(\"par_val_1\", \"par_val_2\", \"par_val_3\", \"par_val_4\"),\n      output_file = c(\"f1.html\", \"f2.html\", \"f3.html\", \"f4.html\")\n    ),\n    batches = 2\n  )\n)\n\nwhere report.Rmd has the following YAML front matter:\ntitle: report\noutput_format: html_document\nparams:\n  par: \"default value\"\nand the following R code chunk:\n\nprint(params$par)\nprint(tar_read(x))\n\ntar_render_rep() creates a target for the parameter grid and uses dynamic branching to render the output reports in batches. In this case, we have two batches (dynamic branches) that each produce two reports (four output reports total).\n\n# R console\ntar_make()\n#> ● run target x\n#> ● run target report_params\n#> ● run branch report_9e7470a1\n#> ● run branch report_457829de\n#> ● end pipeline\n\nThe third output file f3.html is below, and the rest look similar.\n\nFor more information, see these examples."

    "section": "10.2 Target Markdown",
    "text": "10.2 Target Markdown\nTarget Markdown, available in targets > 0.6.0, is a powerful Markdown/knitr-based interface for reproducible analysis pipelines.2 With Target Markdown, you can define a fully scalable pipeline from within one or more Quarto or R Markdown reports or projects (even spreading a single pipeline over multiple source documents). You get the best of both worlds: the human readable narrative of literate programming, and the sophisticated caching and dependency management systems of targets.\n\n10.2.1 Access\nThis chapter’s example Target Markdown document is itself a tutorial and a simplified version of the chapter. There are two convenient ways to access the file:\n\nThe use_targets() function.\nThe RStudio R Markdown template system.\n\nFor (2), in the RStudio IDE, select a new Quarto or R Markdown document in the New File dropdown menu in the upper left-hand corner of the window.\n\nThen, select the Target Markdown template and click OK to open a copy of the report for editing.\n\n\n\n10.2.2 Purpose\nTarget Markdown has two primary objectives:\n\nInteractively explore, prototype, and test the components of a targets pipeline using the Quarto notebook interface or the R Markdown notebook interface.\nSet up a targets pipeline using convenient Markdown-like code chunks.\n\nTarget Markdown supports a special {targets} language engine with an interactive mode for (1) and a non-interactive mode for (2). By default, the mode is interactive in the notebook interface and non-interactive when you knit/render the whole document.3. You can set the mode using the tar_interactive chunk option.\n\n\n10.2.3 Example\nThe following example is based on the minimal targets project at https://github.com/wlandau/targets-minimal/. We process the base airquality dataset, fit a model, and display a histogram of ozone concentration.\n\n\n10.2.4 Required packages\nThis example requires several R packages, and targets must be version 0.6.0 or above.\n\n# R console\ninstall.packages(c(\"biglm\", \"dplyr\", \"ggplot2\", \"readr\", \"targets\", \"tidyr\"))\n\n\n\n10.2.5 Setup\nFirst, load targets to activate the specialized knitr engine for Target Markdown.\n```{r}\nlibrary(targets)\n```\n\n\n\nNon-interactive Target Markdown writes scripts to a special _targets_r/ directory to define individual targets and global objects. In order to keep your target definitions up to date, it is recommended to remove _targets_r/ at the beginning of the R Markdown document(s) in order to clear out superfluous targets and globals from a previous version. tar_unscript() is a convenient way to do this.\n```{r}\ntar_unscript()\n```\n\n\n10.2.6 Globals\nAs usual, your targets depend on custom functions, global objects, and tar_option_set() options you define before the pipeline begins. Define these globals using the {targets} engine with tar_globals = TRUE chunk option.\n```{targets some-globals, tar_globals = TRUE, tar_interactive = TRUE}\noptions(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE)\ntar_option_set(packages = c(\"biglm\", \"dplyr\", \"ggplot2\", \"readr\", \"tidyr\"))\ncreate_plot <- function(data) {\n  ggplot(data) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(x = Ozone), bins = 12) +\n    theme_gray(24)\n}\n```\nIn interactive mode, the chunk simply runs the R code in the tar_option_get(\"envir\") environment (usually the global environment) and displays a message:\n::: {.cell tar_globals=‘true’ tar_interactive=‘true’} ::: {.cell tar_globals=‘true’ tar_interactive=‘true’ tar_name=‘some-globals’ tar_script=’_targets.R’}\n\n#> Run code and assign objects to the environment.\n\n\n\n\nHere is the same chunk in non-interactive mode. Normally, there is no need to duplicate chunks like this, but we do so here in order to demonstrate both modes.\n```{targets chunk-name, tar_globals = TRUE, tar_interactive = FALSE}\noptions(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE)\ntar_option_set(packages = c(\"biglm\", \"dplyr\", \"ggplot2\", \"readr\", \"tidyr\"))\ncreate_plot <- function(data) {\n  ggplot(data) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(x = Ozone), bins = 12) +\n    theme_gray(24)\n}\n```\nIn non-interactive mode, the chunk establishes a common _targets.R file and writes the R code to a script in _targets_r/globals/, and displays an informative message:4\n\n#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/globals/chunk-name.R.\n\nIt is good practice to assign explicit chunk labels or set the tar_name chunk option on a chunk-by-chunk basis. Each chunk writes code to a script path that depends on the name, and all script paths need to be unique.5\n\n\n10.2.7 Target definitions\nTo define targets of the pipeline, use the {targets} language engine with the tar_globals chunk option equal FALSE or NULL (default). The return value of the chunk must be a target object or a list of target objects, created by tar_target() or a similar function.\nBelow, we define a target to establish the air quality dataset in the pipeline.\n```{targets raw-data, tar_interactive = TRUE}\ntar_target(raw_data, airquality)\n```\nIf you run this chunk in interactive mode, the target’s R command runs, the engine tests if the output can be saved and loaded from disk correctly, and then the return value gets assigned to the tar_option_get(\"envir\") environment (usually the global environment).\n::: {.cell tar_interactive=‘true’} ::: {.cell tar_interactive=‘true’ tar_name=‘raw-data’ tar_script=’_targets.R’}\n\n#> Run targets and assign them to the environment.\n\n\n\n\nIn the process, some temporary files are created and destroyed, but your local file space will remain untouched (barring any custom side effects in your custom code).\nAfter you run a target in interactive mode, the return value is available in memory, and you can write an ordinary R code chunk to read it.\n```{r}\nhead(raw_data)\n```\nThe output is the same as what tar_read(raw_data) would show after a serious pipeline run.\n\nhead(raw_data)\n#>   Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day\n#> 1    41     190  7.4   67     5   1\n#> 2    36     118  8.0   72     5   2\n#> 3    12     149 12.6   74     5   3\n#> 4    18     313 11.5   62     5   4\n#> 5    NA      NA 14.3   56     5   5\n#> 6    28      NA 14.9   66     5   6\n\nFor demonstration purposes, here is the raw_data target code chunk in non-interactive mode.\n```{targets chunk-name-with-target, tar_interactive = FALSE}\ntar_target(raw_data, airquality)\n```\nIn non-interactive mode, the {targets} engine does not actually run any targets. Instead, it establishes a common _targets.R and writes the code to a script in _targets_r/targets/.\n\n#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/chunk-name-with-target.R.\n\nNext, we define more targets to process the raw data and plot a histogram. Only the returned value of the chunk code actually becomes part of the pipeline, so if you define multiple targets in a single chunk, be sure to wrap them all in a list.\n```{targets downstream-targets}\nlist(\n  tar_target(data, raw_data %>% filter(!is.na(Ozone))),\n  tar_target(hist, create_plot(data))\n)\n```\nIn non-interactive mode, the whole target list gets written to a single script.\n\n#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/downstream-targets.R.\n\nLastly, we define a target to fit a model to the data. For simple targets like this one, we can use convenient shorthand to convert the code in a chunk into a valid target. Simply set the tar_simple chunk option to TRUE.\n```{targets fit, tar_simple = TRUE}\nanalysis_data <- data\nbiglm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, analysis_data)\n```\nWhen the chunk is preprocessed, chunk label (or the tar_name chunk option if you set it) becomes the target name, and the chunk code becomes the target command. All other arguments of tar_target() remain at their default values (configurable with tar_option_set() in a tar_globals = TRUE chunk). The output in the rendered R Markdown document reflects this preprocessing.\n\ntar_target(fit, {\n  biglm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data)\n})\n#> Define target fit from chunk code.\n#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/fit.R.\n\n\n\n10.2.8 Pipeline\nIf you ran all the {targets} chunks in non-interactive mode (i.e. pipeline construction mode), then the target script file and helper scripts should all be established, and you are ready to run the pipeline in with tar_make() in an ordinary {r} code chunk. This time, the output is written to persistent storage at the project root.\n```{r}\ntar_make()\n```\n\n#> • start target raw_data\n#> • built target raw_data [0.766 seconds]\n#> • start target data\n#> • built target data [0.009 seconds]\n#> • start target fit\n#> • built target fit [0.004 seconds]\n#> • start target hist\n#> • built target hist [0.015 seconds]\n#> • end pipeline [0.938 seconds]\n\n\n\n10.2.9 Output\nYou can retrieve results from the _targets/ data store using tar_read() or tar_load().\n```{r}\nlibrary(biglm)\ntar_read(fit)\n```\n\n#> Large data regression model: biglm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data)\n#> Sample size =  116\n\n```{r}\ntar_read(hist)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nThe targets dependency graph helps your readers understand the steps of your pipeline at a high level.\n```{r}\ntar_visnetwork()\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, you can go back and run {targets} chunks in interactive mode without interfering with the code or data of the non-interactive pipeline.\n\n\n10.2.10 Conditioning on interactive mode\ntargets version 0.6.0.9001 and above supports the tar_interactive() function, which suppresses code unless Target Markdown interactive mode is turned on. Similarly, tar_noninteractive() suppresses code in interactive mode, and tar_toggle() selects alternative pieces of code based on the current mode.\n\n\n10.2.11 tar_interactive()\ntar_interactive() is useful for dynamic branching. If a dynamic target branches over a target from a different chunk, this ordinarily breaks interactive mode.\n```{targets condition, tar_interactive = TRUE}\ntar_target(y, x ^ 2, pattern = map(x))\n```\n::: {.cell tar_interactive=‘true’} ::: {.cell tar_interactive=‘true’ tar_name=‘condition’ tar_script=’_targets.R’}\n\n#> Run targets and assign them to the environment.\n\n#> Error:\n#> ! Target y tried to branch over x, which is illegal. Patterns must only branch over explicitly declared targets in the pipeline. Stems and patterns are fine, but you cannot branch over branches or global objects. Also, if you branch over a target with format = \"file\", then that target must also be a pattern.\n\n\nHowever, with tar_interactive(), you can define a version of x just for testing and prototyping in interactive mode. The chunk below fixes interactive mode without changing the pipeline in non-interactive mode.\n```{targets condition-fixed, tar_interactive = TRUE}\nlist(\n  tar_interactive(tar_target(x, seq_len(2))),\n  tar_target(y, x ^ 2, pattern = map(x))\n)\n```\n::: {.cell tar_interactive=‘true’} ::: {.cell tar_interactive=‘true’ tar_name=‘condition-fixed’ tar_script=’_targets.R’}\n\n#> Run targets and assign them to the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.12 tar_toggle()\ntar_toggle() is useful for scaling up and down the amount of work based on the current mode. Interactive mode should finish quickly for prototyping and testing, and non-interactive mode should take on the full level work required for a serious pipeline. Below, tar_toggle() seamlessly scales up and down the number of simulations repetitions in the example target from https://wlandau.github.io/rmedicine2021-pipeline/#target-definitions. To learn more about stantargets, visit https://docs.ropensci.org/stantargets/.\n```{targets bayesian-model-validation, tar_interactive = TRUE}\ntar_stan_mcmc_rep_summary(\n  name = mcmc,\n  stan_files = \"model.stan\",\n  data = simulate_data(), # Defined in another code chunk.\n  batches = tar_toggle(1, 100),\n  reps = tar_toggle(1, 10),\n  chains = tar_toggle(1, 4),\n  parallel_chains = tar_toggle(1, 4),\n  iter_warmup = tar_toggle(100, 4e4),\n  iter_sampling = tar_toggle(100, 4e4),\n  summaries = list(\n    ~posterior::quantile2(.x, probs = c(0.025, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.975)),\n    rhat = ~posterior::rhat(.x)\n  ),\n  deployment = \"worker\"\n)\n```\n\n\n10.2.13 Chunk options\n\ntar_globals: Logical of length 1, whether to define globals or targets. If TRUE, the chunk code defines functions, objects, and options common to all the targets. If FALSE or NULL (default), then the chunk returns formal targets for the pipeline.\ntar_interactive: Logical of length 1 to choose whether to run the chunk in interactive mode or non-interactive mode.\ntar_name: name to use for writing helper script files (e.g. _targets_r/targets/target_script.R) and specifying target names if the tar_simple chunk option is TRUE. All helper scripts and target names must have unique names, so please do not set this option globally with knitr::opts_chunk$set().\ntar_script: Character of length 1, where to write the target script file in non-interactive mode. Most users can skip this option and stick with the default _targets.R script path. Helper script files are always written next to the target script in a folder with an \"_r\" suffix. The tar_script path must either be absolute or be relative to the project root (where you call tar_make() or similar). If not specified, the target script path defaults to tar_config_get(\"script\") (default: _targets.R; helpers default: _targets_r/). When you run tar_make() etc. with a non-default target script, you must select the correct target script file either with the script argument or with tar_config_set(script = ...). The function will source() the script file from the current working directory (i.e. with chdir = FALSE in source()).\ntar_simple: Logical of length 1. Set to TRUE to define a single target with a simplified interface. In code chunks with tar_simple equal to TRUE, the chunk label (or the tar_name chunk option if you set it) becomes the name, and the chunk code becomes the command. In other words, a code chunk with label targetname and command mycommand() automatically gets converted to tar_target(name = targetname, command = mycommand()). All other arguments of tar_target() remain at their default values (configurable with tar_option_set() in a tar_globals = TRUE chunk)."

Prior to launching the pipeline, the user does not need to know the number of branches or the input data of each branch.\nTo use dynamic branching, set the pattern argument of tar_target(). The pattern determines how dynamic branches are created and how the input data is partitioned among the branches. A branch is single iteration of the target’s command on a single piece of the input data. Branches are automatically created based on how the input data breaks into pieces, and targets automatically combines the output from all the branches when you reference the dynamic target as a whole."

That way, if a branch errors out, it is easy to track down the upstream data that caused it.2\n\ntar_read(points, branches = 1) # first branch\n#> # A tibble: 10,000 × 4\n#>        x     y fixed_radius cycling_radius\n#>    <dbl> <dbl>        <int>          <int>\n#>  1 -2.46 -4.43            3              9\n#>  2 -2.41 -4.46            3              9\n#>  3 -2.37 -4.48            3              9\n#>  4 -2.33 -4.50            3              9\n#>  5 -2.28 -4.53            3              9\n#>  6 -2.24 -4.55            3              9\n#>  7 -2.19 -4.57            3              9\n#>  8 -2.15 -4.60            3              9\n#>  9 -2.10 -4.62            3              9\n#> 10 -2.06 -4.64            3              9\n#> # … with 9,990 more rows\n\n\ntar_read(points, branches = 2) # second branch\n#> # A tibble: 10,000 × 4\n#>        x     y fixed_radius cycling_radius\n#>    <dbl> <dbl>        <int>          <int>\n#>  1  1.90  3.61            7              2\n#>  2  1.85  3.65            7              2\n#>  3  1.79  3.70            7              2\n#>  4  1.74  3.74            7              2\n#>  5  1.69  3.78            7              2\n#>  6  1.64  3.83            7              2\n#>  7  1.59  3.87            7              2\n#>  8  1.53  3.91            7              2\n#>  9  1.48  3.96            7              2\n#> 10  1.43  4.00            7              2\n#> # … with 9,990 more rows"

In other words, the first branch of points is spirograph_points(vec_slice(fixed_radius, 1), vec_slice(cycling_radius, 1)), and second branch of points is spirograph_points(vec_slice(fixed_radius, 2), vec_slice(cycling_radius, 2)). Since fixed_radius is a numeric vector, vec_slice(fixed_radius, 1) is a vector of length 1. (But if fixed_radius were a data frame, then vec_slice(fixed_radius, 1) would be a one-row data frame). If iteration were equal to \"list\" for fixed_radius and cycling_radius, then the first and second branches would instead be spirograph_points(fixed_radius[[1]], cycling_radius[[1]]) and spirograph_points(fixed_radius[[2]]), respectively.\nFor dynamic target points, iteration = \"vector\" means all the branches are aggregated with vctrs::vec_c(). Since each branch of points is a data frame, aggregation is equivalent to dplyr::bind_rows() in this case. That is why, as previously shown, tar_read(points) returns a monolithic data frame. points becomes a monolithic data frame also when non-dynamic target combined_plot runs its command plot_spirographs(points). In other words, plot_spirographs(points) is equivalent to plot_spirographs(vec_c(points_940d58fc, points_bf28fe5a)), where points_940d58fc and points_bf28fe5a are the individual branches of points.3.

    "text": "11.9 Performance and batching\nDynamic branching makes it easy to create many targets. Unfortunately, if the number of targets exceeds several thousand, overhead may build up and the package may slow down. Temporary workarounds can avoid overhead in specific cases: for example, the shortcut argument of tar_make(), and choosing a pattern like slice() or head() instead of a full map(). But to minimize overhead at scale, it is better to accomplish the same amount of work with a fewer number of targets. In other words, do more work inside each dynamic branch.\nBatching is particularly useful to reduce overhead. In batching, each dynamic branch performs multiple computations instead of just one. The tarchetypes package supports several general-purpose functions that do batching automatically: most notably tar_rep() and tar_map_rep() for simulation studies and tar_group_count(), tar_group_size(), and tar_group_select() for batching over the rows of a data frame.\nThe packages in the R Targetopia support batching for specific use cases. For example, in stantargets, tar_stan_mcmc_rep_summary() dynamically branches over batches of simulated datasets for Stan models.\nThe targets-stan repository has an example of custom batching implemented from scratch. The goal of the pipeline is to validate a Bayesian model by simulating thousands of dataset, analyzing each with a Bayesian model, and assessing the overall accuracy of the inference. Rather than define a target for each dataset in model, the pipeline breaks up the work into batches, where each batch has multiple datasets or multiple analyses. Here is a version of the pipeline with 40 batches and 25 simulation reps per batch (1000 reps total in a pipeline of 82 targets).\n\n# _targets.R\nlibrary(targets)\nlist(\n  tar_target(model_file, compile_model(\"stan/model.stan\"), format = \"file\"),\n  tar_target(index_batch, seq_len(40)),\n  tar_target(index_sim, seq_len(25)),\n  tar_target(\n    data_continuous,\n    purrr::map_dfr(index_sim, ~simulate_data_continuous()),\n    pattern = map(index_batch)\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    fit_continuous,\n    map_sims(data_continuous, model_file = model_file),\n    pattern = map(data_continuous)\n  )\n)"

Whereas dynamic branching excels at creating a large number of very similar targets, static branching is most useful for smaller number of heterogeneous targets.

When it substitutes an element from values, it needs a way to transform the element into valid R code. For elements even a little bit complicated, especially nested data frames and objects with attributes, this is not always possible. For these complicated elements, it is best to use quote() to work with the underlying expressions instead of the objects themselves.

    "text": "13.1 Clustermq\ntar_make_clustermq() uses the clustermq package, and prior familiarity with clustermq is extremely helpful for configuring targets and diagnosing errors. So before you use tar_make_clustermq(), please read the documentation at https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/ and try out clustermq directly. If you plan to use a scheduler like SLURM or SGE, please configure and experiment with clustermq on your scheduler without targets. And if you later experience issues with tar_make_clustermq(), try to isolate the problem by creating a reproducible example that uses clustermq and not targets. Peeling back layers can help isolate problems and point toward specific solutions, and targets is usually one of the outer layers.\n\n13.1.1 Persistent workers\ntar_make_clustermq() uses persistent workers. A persistent worker is an R process that launches early in the pipeline and stays running until the whole pipeline starts to wind down. A persistent worker usually runs multiple targets during its lifecycle, and it is not possible to precisely predict in advance which targets will be assigned to which workers. The video clip below visualizes the concept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.1.2 Clustermq installation\nPersistent workers require the clustermq R package, which in turn requires ZeroMQ. Please refer to the clustermq installation guide for specific instructions.\n\n\n13.1.3 Automatic configuration with use_targets()\nIf clustermq is installed, then use_targets() function configures clustermq automatically. use_targets() tries to detect the cluster you are using and write the appropriate _targets.R settings clustermq configuration files commensurate with your system resources. On most systems, this should allow you you to run tar_make_clustermq() with no extra configuration. If so, you can skip the rest of the clustermq section. If not, read on to learn how to configure clustermq for targets.\n\n\n13.1.4 Clustermq local configuration\nTo utilize parallel computing on your local machine, set the clustermq.scheduler option to \"multicore\" or \"multiprocess\" in your _targets.R file. See the configuration instructions for details.\n\n# _targets.R\noptions(clustermq.scheduler = \"multiprocess\")\nlist(\n  tar_target(data, get_data()),\n  tar_target(fast_fit, fit_small_model(data)),\n  tar_target(slow_fit, fit_slow_model(data)),\n  tar_target(plot_1, make_plot(fast_fit)),\n  tar_target(plot_2, make_plot(slow_fit))\n)\n\nThen, run tar_make_clustermq() with the appropriate number of workers. These workers are local R processes that run concurrently to run the outdated targets in the pipeline. The workers launch as soon as there is an outdated target with deployment = \"worker\", and they continue running until there are no more targets to run.\n\n# R console\ntar_make_clustermq(workers = 2)\n\n\n\n13.1.5 Clustermq remote configuration\nA cluster is a collection of multiple computers that work together to run computationally demanding workloads. A cluster is capable of running far more tasks simultaneously than a local workstation like a PC or laptop. When configured for a cluster, tar_make_clustermq() uses clustermq to run persistent workers as long-running distributed jobs. To manually set the configuration,\n\nChoose a scheduler listed here that corresponds to your cluster’s resource manager.\nCreate a template file that configures the computing requirements and other settings for the cluster.\n\nSupply the scheduler option and template file to the clustermq.scheduler and clustermq.template global options in your target script file (default: _targets.R).\n\n# _targets.R\noptions(clustermq.scheduler = \"sge\", clustermq.template = \"sge.tmpl\")\nlist(\n  tar_target(data, get_data()),\n  tar_target(fast_fit, fit_small_model(data)),\n  tar_target(slow_fit, fit_slow_model(data)),\n  tar_target(plot_1, make_plot(fast_fit)),\n  tar_target(plot_2, make_plot(slow_fit))\n)\n\nAbove, sge_tmpl refers to a template file like the one below.\n## From https://github.com/mschubert/clustermq/wiki/SGE\n#$ -N {{ job_name }}  # Worker name.\n#$ -t 1-{{ n_jobs }}  # Submit workers as an array.\n#$ -j y               # Combine stdout and stderr into one worker log file.\n#$ -o /dev/null       # Worker log files.\n#$ -cwd               # Use project root as working directory.\n#$ -V                 # Use environment variables.\nmodule load R/3.6.3   # Needed if R is an environment module on the cluster.\nCMQ_AUTH={{ auth }} R --no-save --no-restore -e 'clustermq:::worker(\"{{ main }}\")' # Leave alone.\nThen, run tar_make_clustermq() as before. Instead of running locally, the workers will run as jobs on the cluster. Because they are persistent workers, they launch as soon as there is an outdated target with deployment = \"worker\", and they continue running until they complete their current targets and there are no more targets to assign.\n\n# R console\ntar_make_clustermq(workers = 2)\n\nSee the examples linked from here to see how this setup works in real-world projects.\n\n\n13.1.6 Clustermq template file configuration\nIn addition to configuration options hard-coded in the template file, you can supply custom computing resources with the resources argument of tar_option_set(). As an example, let’s use a wildcard for the number of cores per worker on an SGE cluster. In the template file, supply {{ num_cores }} wildcard to the -pe smp flag.\n#$ -pe smp {{ num_cores }} # Number of cores per worker\n#$ -N {{ job_name | 1 }}\n#$ -t 1-{{ n_jobs }}\n#$ -j y\n#$ -o /dev/null\n#$ -cwd\n#$ -V\nmodule load R/3.6.3\nCMQ_AUTH={{ auth }} R --no-save --no-restore -e 'clustermq:::worker(\"{{ main }}\")'\nThen, supply the value of num_cores to the resources option from within the target script file (default: _targets.R). In older version of targets, resources was a named list. In targets 0.5.0.9000 and above, please create the resources argument with helpers tar_resources() and tar_resources_clustermq().\n\n# _targets.R\n# With older versions of targets:\n# tar_option_set(resources = list(num_cores = 2))\n# With targets >= 0.5.0.9000:\ntar_option_set(\n  resources = tar_resources(\n    clustermq = tar_resources_clustermq(template = list(num_cores = 2))\n  )\n)\nlist(\n  tar_target(...),\n  ... # more targets\n)\n\nFinally, call tar_make_clustermq() normally.\n\n# R console\ntar_make_clustermq(workers = 2)\n\nThis particular use case comes up when you have custom parallel computing within targets and need to take advantage of multiple cores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclustermq resources\n\n\n\nRemember: with tar_make_clustermq(), the workers are persistent, which means there is not a one-to-one correspondence between workers and targets. In the resources arguemnt of tar_option_set(), the clustermq-specific resources apply to the workers, not the targets directly. So in the resources argument of tar_target(), any clustermq-specific will be ignored. tar_option_set() is the only way to set clustermq resources."

So before you use tar_make_future(), please read the documentation at https://future.futureverse.org/ and try out future directly, ideally with backends like future.callr and possibly future.batchtools. If you plan to use a scheduler like SLURM or SGE, please configure and experiment with future on your scheduler without targets. And if you later experience issues with tar_make_future(), try to isolate the problem by creating a reproducible example that uses future and not targets. Same goes for future.batchtools if applicable. Peeling back layers can help isolate problems and point toward specific solutions, and targets is usually one of the outer layers.\n\n13.2.1 Transient workers\ntar_make_future() runs transient workers. That means each target gets its own worker which initializes when the target begins and terminates when the target ends. The following video clip demonstrates the concept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.2.2 Automatic configuration with use_targets()\nIf future and future.batchtools are installed, then use_targets() function configures future automatically. use_targets() tries to detect the cluster you are using and write the appropriate _targets.R settings, and if appropriate, the batchtools configuration file commensurate with your system resources. On most systems, this should allow you you to run tar_make_future() with no extra configuration. If so, you can skip the rest of the future section. If not, read on to learn how to configure future for targets.\n\n\n13.2.3 Future installation\nInstall the future package.\n\ninstall.packages(\"future\")\n\nIf you intend to use a cluster, be sure to install the future.batchtools package too.\n\ninstall.packages(\"future.batchtools\")\n\nThe future ecosystem contains even more packages that extend future’s parallel computing functionality, such as future.callr.\n\ninstall.packages(\"future.callr\")\n\n\n\n13.2.4 Future locally\nIf you ar manually configuring future/future.batchtools for your pipeline, declare a future plan in your target script file (default: _targets.R). The callr plan from the future.callr package is recommended.3 It is crucial that future::plan() is called in the target script file itself - defining a plan interactively before invoking tar_make_future() does not leverage the future package.\n\n# _targets.R\nlibrary(future)\nlibrary(future.callr)\nplan(callr)\nlist(\n  tar_target(data, get_data()),\n  tar_target(fast_fit, fit_small_model(data)),\n  tar_target(slow_fit, fit_slow_model(data)),\n  tar_target(plot_1, make_plot(fast_fit)),\n  tar_target(plot_2, make_plot(slow_fit))\n)\n\nThen, run tar_make_future() with the desired number of workers. Here, the workers argument specifies the maximum number of transient workers to allow at a given time. Some future plans also have optional workers arguments that set their own caps.\n\n# R console\ntar_make_future(workers = 2)\n\n\n\n13.2.5 Future remotely\nTo run transient workers on a cluster, first install the future.batchtools package. Then, set one of these plans in your target script file (default: _targets.R).\n\n# _targets.R\nlibrary(future)\nlibrary(future.batchtools)\nplan(batchtools_sge, template = \"sge.tmpl\")\nlist(\n  tar_target(data, get_data()),\n  tar_target(fast_fit, fit_small_model(data)),\n  tar_target(slow_fit, fit_slow_model(data)),\n  tar_target(plot_1, make_plot(fast_fit)),\n  tar_target(plot_2, make_plot(slow_fit))\n)\n\nHere, our template file sge.tmpl is configured for batchtools.\n#!/bin/bash\n#$ -cwd               # Run in the current working directory.\n#$ -j y               # Direct stdout and stderr to the same file.\n#$ -o <%= log.file %> # log file\n#$ -V                 # Use environment variables.\n#$ -N <%= job.name %> # job name\nmodule load R/3.6.3   # Uncomment and adjust if R is an environment module.\nRscript -e 'batchtools::doJobCollection(\"<%= uri %>\")' # Leave alone.\nexit 0 # Leave alone.\n\n\n13.2.6 Future configuration\nThe tar_target(), tar_target_raw(), and tar_option_set() functions accept a resources argument.4 For example, if our batchtools template file has a wildcard for the number of cores for a job,\n#!/bin/bash\n#$ -pe smp <%= resources[[\"num_cores\"]] | 1 %> # Wildcard for cores per job.\n#$ -cwd\n#$ -j y\n#$ -o <%= log.file %>\n#$ -V\n#$ -N <%= job.name %>\nmodule load R/3.6.3\nRscript -e 'batchtools::doJobCollection(\"<%= uri %>\")'\nexit 0\nthen you can set the number of cores for an individual target using a target-specific future plan. In the case below, maybe the slow model needs 2 cores to run fast enough. Because of the resources[[\"num_cores\"]] placeholder in the above template file, we can control the number of cores in each target through its local plan.5\n\n# _targets.R\nlibrary(future)\nlibrary(future.batchtools)\nplan(batchtools_sge, template = \"sge.tmpl\")\nlist(\n  tar_target(data, get_data()),\n  tar_target(fast_fit, fit_small_model(data)),\n  # With older version of targets:\n  # tar_target(slow_fit, fit_slow_model(data), resources = list(num_cores = 2)),\n  # With targets >= 0.5.0.9000:\n  tar_target(\n    slow_fit,\n    fit_slow_model(data),\n    resources = tar_resources(\n      future = tar_resources_future(\n        plan = tweak(\n          batchtools_sge,\n          template = \"sge.tmpl\",\n          resources = list(num_cores = 2)\n        )\n      )\n    )\n  ),\n  tar_target(plot_1, make_plot(fast_fit)),\n  tar_target(plot_2, make_plot(slow_fit))\n)\n\nThen, run tar_make_future() as usual.\n\n# R console\ntar_make_future(workers = 2)"

    "text": "13.3 Advanced\nFunctions tar_target(), tar_target_raw(), and tar_option_set() support advanced configuration options for heavy-duty pipelines that require high-performance computing.\n\ndeployment: With the deployment argument, you can choose to run some targets locally on the main process instead of on a high-performance computing worker. This options is suitable for lightweight targets such as R Markdown reports where runtime is quick and a cluster would be excessive.\nmemory: Choose whether to retain a target in memory or remove it from memory whenever it is not needed at the moment. This is a tradeoff between memory consumption and storage read speeds, and like all of the options listed here, you can set it on a target-by-target basis. The default settings consume a lot of memory to avoid frequently reading from storage. To keep memory usage down to a minimum, set memory = \"transient\" and garbage_collection = TRUE in tar_target() or tar_option_set(). For cloud-based dynamic files such as format = \"aws_file\", this memory policy applies to temporary local copies of the file in _targets/scratch/: \"persistent\" means they remain until the end of the pipeline, and \"transient\" means they get deleted from the file system as soon as possible. The former conserves bandwidth, and the latter conserves local storage.\ngarbage_collection: Choose whether to run base::gc() just before running the target.\nstorage: Choose whether the parallel workers or the main process is responsible for saving the target’s value. For slow network file systems on clusters, storage = \"main\" is often faster for small numbers of targets. For large numbers of targets or low-bandwidth connections between the main and workers, storage = \"worker\" is often faster. Always choose storage = \"main\" if the workers do not have access to the file system with the _targets/ data store.\nretrieval: Choose whether the parallel workers or the main process is responsible for reading dependency targets from disk. Should usually be set to whatever you choose for storage (default). Always choose retrieval = \"main\" if the workers do not have access to the file system with the _targets/ data store.\nformat: If your pipeline has large computation, it may also have large data. Consider setting the format argument to help targets store and retrieve your data faster.\nerror: Set error to \"continue\" to let the rest of the pipeline keep running even if a target encounters an error."

Solutions in drake itself would make the package incompatible with existing projects that use it, and the internal architecture is too copious, elaborate, and mature for such extreme refactoring. That is why targets was created. The targets package borrows from past learnings, user suggestions, discussions, complaints, success stories, and feature requests, and it improves the user experience in ways that will never be possible in drake."

    "section": "14.3 Advantages of targets over drake",
    "text": "14.3 Advantages of targets over drake\n\n14.3.1 Better guardrails by design\ndrake leaves ample room for user-side mistakes, and some of these mistakes require extra awareness or advanced knowledge of R to consistently avoid. The example behaviors below are too systemic to solve and still preserve back-compatibility.\n\nBy default, make() looks for functions and global objects in the parent environment of the calling R session. Because the global environment is often old and stale in practical situations, which causes targets to become incorrectly invalidated. Users need to remember to restart the session before calling make(). The issue is discussed here, and the discussion led to functions like r_make() which always create a fresh session to do the work. However, r_make() is not a complete replacement for make(), and beginner users still run into the original problems.\nSimilar to the above, make() does not find the intended functions and global objects if it is called in a different environment. Edge cases like this one and this one continue to surprise users.\ndrake is extremely flexible about the location of the .drake/ cache. When a user calls readd(), loadd(), make(), and similar functions, drake searches up through the parent directories until it finds a .drake/ folder. This flexibility seldom helps, and it creates uncertainty and inconsistency when it comes to initializing and accessing projects, especially if there are multiple projects with nested file systems.\n\nThe targets package solves all these issues by design. Functions tar_make(), tar_make_clustermq(), and tar_make_future() all create fresh new R sessions by default. They all require a _targets.R configuration file in the project root (working directory of the tar_make() call) so that the functions, global objects, and settings are all populated in the exact same way each session, leading to less frustration, greater consistency, and greater reproducibility. In addition, the _targets/ data store always lives in the project root.\n\n\n14.3.2 Enhanced debugging support\ntargets has enhanced debugging support. With the workspaces argument to tar_option_set(), users can locally recreate the conditions under which a target runs. This includes packages, global functions and objects, and the random number generator seed. Similarly, tar_option_set(error = \"workspace\") automatically saves debugging workspaces for targets that encounter errors. The debug option lets users enter an interactive debugger for a given target while the pipeline is running. And unlike drake, all debugging features are fully compatible with dynamic branching.\n\n\n14.3.3 Improved tracking of package functions\nBy default, targets ignores changes to functions inside external packages. However, if a workflow centers on a custom package with methodology under development, users can make targets automatically watch the package’s functions for changes. Simply supply the names of the relevant packages to the imports argument of tar_option_set(). Unlike drake, targets can track multiple packages this way, and the internal mechanism is much safer.\n\n\n14.3.4 Lighter, friendlier data management\ndrake’s cache is an intricate file system in a hidden .drake folder. It contains multiple files for each target, and those names are not informative. (See the files in the data/ folder in the diagram below.) Users often have trouble understanding how drake manages data, resolving problems when files are corrupted, placing the data under version control, collaborating with others on the same pipeline, and clearing out superfluous data when the cache grows large in storage.\n.drake/\n├── config/\n├── data/\n├───── 17bfcef645301416.rds\n├───── 21935c86f12692e2.rds\n├───── 37caf5df2892cfc4.rds\n├───── ...\n├── drake/\n├───── history/\n├───── return/\n├───── tmp/\n├── keys/ # A surprisingly large number of tiny text files live here.\n├───── memoize/\n├───── meta/\n├───── objects/\n├───── progress/\n├───── recover/\n├───── session/\n└── scratch/ # This folder should be temporary, but it gets egregiously large.\nThe targets takes a friendlier, more transparent, less mysterious approach to data management. Its data store is a visible _targets folder, and it contains far fewer files: a spreadsheet of metadata, a spreadsheet of target progress, and one informatively named data file for each target. It is much easier to understand the data management process, identify and diagnose problems, place projects under version control, and avoid consuming unnecessary storage resources. Sketch:\n_targets/\n├── meta/\n├───── meta\n├───── process\n├───── progress\n├── objects/\n├───── target_name_1\n├───── target_name_2\n├───── target_name_3\n├───── ...\n├── scratch/ # tar_make() deletes this folder after it finishes.\n└── user/ # gittargets users can put custom files here for data version control.\n\n\n14.3.5 Cloud storage\nThanks to the simplified data store and simplified internals, targets can automatically upload data to the Amazon S3 bucket of your choice. Simply configure aws.s3, create a bucket, and select one of the AWS-powered storage formats. Then, targets will automatically upload the return values to the cloud.\n\n# _targets.R\ntar_option_set(resources = list(bucket = \"my-bucket-name\"))\nlist(\n  tar_target(dataset, get_large_dataset(), format = \"aws_fst_tbl\"),\n  tar_target(analysis, analyze_dataset(dataset), format = \"aws_qs\")\n)\n\nData retrieval is still super easy.\n\ntar_read(dataset)\n\n\n\n14.3.6 Show status of functions and global objects\ndrake has several utilities that inform users which targets are up to date and which need to rerun. However, those utilities are limited by how drake manages functions and other global objects. Whenever drake inspects globals, it stores their values in its cache and loses track of their previous state from the last run of the pipeline. As a result, it has trouble informing users exactly why a given target is out of date. And because the system for tracking global objects is tightly coupled with the cache, this limitation is permanent.\nIn targets, the metadata management system only updates information on global objects when the pipeline actually runs. This makes it possible to understand which specific changes to your code could have invalided your targets. In large projects with long runtimes, this feature contributes significantly to reproducibility and peace of mind.\n\n\n\n14.3.7 Dynamic branching with dplyr::group_by()\nDynamic branching was an architecturally difficult fit in drake, and it can only support one single (vctrs-based) method of slicing and aggregation for processing sub-targets. This limitation has frustrated members of the community, as discussed here and here.\ntargets, on the other hand, is more flexible regarding slicing and aggregation. When it branches over an object, it can iterate over vectors, lists, and even data frames grouped with dplyr::group_by(). To branch over chunks of a data frame, our data frame target needs to have a special tar_group column. We can create this column in our target’s return value with the tar_group() function.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n#> \n#> Attaching package: 'dplyr'\n#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n#> \n#>     filter, lag\n#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n#> \n#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\nlibrary(targets)\nlibrary(tibble)\ntibble(\n  x = seq_len(6),\n  id = rep(letters[seq_len(3)], each = 2)\n) %>%\n  group_by(id) %>%\n  tar_group()\n#> # A tibble: 6 × 3\n#>       x id    tar_group\n#>   <int> <chr>     <int>\n#> 1     1 a             1\n#> 2     2 a             1\n#> 3     3 b             2\n#> 4     4 b             2\n#> 5     5 c             3\n#> 6     6 c             3\n\nOur actual target has the command above and iteration = \"group\".\n\ntar_target(\n  data,\n  tibble(\n    x = seq_len(6),\n    id = rep(letters[seq_len(3)], each = 2)\n  ) %>%\n    group_by(id) %>%\n    tar_group(),\n  iteration = \"group\"\n)\n\nNow, any target that maps over data is going to define one branch for each group in the data frame. The following target creates three branches when run in a pipeline: one returning 3, one returning 7, and one returning 11.\n\ntar_target(\n  sums,\n  sum(data$x),\n  pattern = map(data)\n)\n\n\n\n14.3.8 Composable dynamic branching\nBecause the design of targets is fundamentally dynamic, users can create complicated dynamic branching patterns that are never going to be possible in drake. Below, target z creates six branches, one for each combination of w and tuple (x, y). The pattern cross(w, map(x, y)) is equivalent to tidyr::crossing(w, tidyr::nesting(x, y)).\n\n# _targets.R\nlibrary(targets)\nlist(\n  tar_target(w, seq_len(2)),\n  tar_target(x, head(letters, 3)),\n  tar_target(y, head(LETTERS, 3)),\n  tar_target(\n    z,\n    data.frame(w = w, x = x, y = y),\n    pattern = cross(w, map(x, y))\n  )\n)\n\nThanks to glep and djbirke on GitHub for the idea.\n\n\n14.3.9 Improved parallel efficiency\nDynamic branching in drake is staged. In other words, all the sub-targets of a dynamic target must complete before the pipeline moves on to downstream targets. The diagram below illustrates this behavior in a pipeline with a dynamic target B that maps over another dynamic target A. For thousands of dynamic sub-targets with highly variable runtimes, this behavior consumes unnecessary runtime and computing resources. And because drake’s architecture was designed at a fundamental level for static branching only, this limitation is permanent.\n\nBy contrast, the internal data structures in targets are dynamic by design, which allows for a dynamic branching model with more flexibility and parallel efficiency. Branches can always start as soon as their upstream dependencies complete, even if some of those upstream dependencies are branches. This behavior reduces runtime and reduces consumption of computing resources.\n\n\n\n14.3.10 Metaprogramming\nIn drake, pipelines are defined with the drake_plan() function. drake_plan() supports an elaborate domain specific language that diffuses user-supplied R expressions. This makes it convenient to assign commands to targets in the vast majority of cases, but it also obstructs custom metaprogramming by users (example here). Granted, it is possible to completely circumvent drake_plan() and create the whole data frame from scratch, but this is hardly ideal and seldom done in practice.\nThe targets package tries to make customization easier. Relative to drake, targets takes a decentralized approach to setting up pipelines, moving as much custom configuration as possible to the target level rather than the whole pipeline level. In addition, the tar_target_raw() function avoids non-standard evaluation while mirroring tar_target() in all other respects. All this makes it much easier to create custom metaprogrammed pipelines and target archetypes while avoiding an elaborate domain specific language for static branching, which was extremely difficult to understand and error prone in drake. The R Targetopia is an emerging ecosystem of workflow frameworks that take full advantage of this customization and democratize reproducible pipelines."
