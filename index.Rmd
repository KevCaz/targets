# Introduction {#intro}

The [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) package is a [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)-like pipeline toolkit for Statistics and data science in R. With [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/), you can maintain a reproducible workflow without repeating yourself. [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) learns how your pipeline fits together, skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, runs only the necessary computation, supports implicit parallel computing, abstracts files as R objects, and shows tangible evidence that the results match the underlying code and data.

## Motivation

Data analysis can be slow. A round of scientific computation can take several minutes, hours, or even days to complete. After it finishes, if you update your code or data, your hard-earned results may no longer be valid. Unchecked, this invalidation creates chronic [Sisyphean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus) loop:

1. Launch the code.
2. Wait while it runs.
3. Discover an issue.
4. Restart from scratch.

## Pipeline toolkits

[Pipeline toolkits](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline) like [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) break the cycle. They watch the dependency graph of the whole workflow and skip steps, or "targets", whose code, data, and upstream dependencies have not changed since the last run of the pipeline. When all targets are up to date, this is evidence that the results match the underlying code and data, which helps us trust the results and confirm the computation is reproducible.

## The `targets` package

Unlike most [pipeline toolkits](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline), which are language agnostic or Python-focused, the [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) package allows data scientists and researchers to work entirely within R. [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) implicitly nudges users toward a clean, function-oriented programming style that fits the intent of the R language and helps practitioners maintain their data analysis projects.

## About this manual

This manual is a step-by-step user guide to [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/). It [walks through basic usage](#walkthrough), [outlines general best practices](#practice), dives deep into advanced features like [high-performance computing](#hpc), and [helps `drake` users transition to `targets`](#drake). See the [documentation website](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/index.html) for most other major resources, including [installation instructions](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/index.html#installation), links to [example projects](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/index.html#examples), and a [reference page with all user-side functions](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/index.html). 

## What about `drake`?

The [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) is an older R-focused pipeline toolkit, and [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) is [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake)'s long-term successor. There is a [special chapter](#drake) to explain why [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) was created, what this means for [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake)'s future, advice for [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) users transitioning to the [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/), and the main technical advantages of [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) over [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake).
