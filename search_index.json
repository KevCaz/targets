With targets, you can maintain a reproducible workflow without repeating yourself. targets learns how your pipeline fits together, skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, runs only the necessary computation, supports implicit parallel computing, abstracts files as R objects, and shows tangible evidence that the results match the underlying code and data. This manual is a step-by-step written guide to targets. The current chapter elaborates on the role and benefits of targets, and subsequent chapters walk through the major functionality. See the documentation website for most other major resources, including installation instructions, links to example projects, and a reference page with all user-side functions. 1.1 Motivation Data analysis can be slow. A round of scientific computation can take several minutes, hours, or even days to complete. After it finishes, if you update your code or data, your hard-earned results may no longer be valid. Unchecked, this invalidation creates chronic Sisyphean loop: Launch the code. Wait while it runs. Discover an issue. Restart from scratch. 1.2 Pipeline toolkits Pipeline toolkits like GNU Make break the cycle. They watch the dependency graph of the whole workflow and skip steps, or “targets”, whose code, data, and upstream dependencies have not changed since the last run of the pipeline. When all targets are up to date, this is evidence that the results match the underlying code and data, which helps us trust the results and confirm the computation is reproducible. 1.3 The targets package Unlike most pipeline toolkits, which are language agnostic or Python-focused, the targets package allows data scientists and researchers to work entirely within R. targets implicitly nudges users toward a clean, function-oriented programming style that fits the intent of the R language and helps practitioners maintain their data analysis projects. 1.4 What about drake? The drake package is an older and more established R-focused pipeline toolkit. It is has become a key piece of the R ecosystem, and development will continue. However, years of community feedback have exposed major user-side limitations regarding data management, collaboration, parallel efficiency, and pipeline archetypes. Unfortunately, these limitations are permanent. Solutions in drake itself would make the package incompatible with existing projects that use it. That is why targets was created. The targets package borrows from past learnings and attempts to advance the user experience beyond drake’s potential capabilities. Please see the statement of need for technical details. If you know drake, then you already almost know targets. The programming style is similar, and most functions in targets have counterparts in drake.

Example targets pipelines are in individual repositories linked from here. drake_build() Unsupported in targets to ensure coherence with dynamic branching. drake_debug() Read here to learn about interactive debugging in targets. drake_history(), recoverable() Unsupported in targets. Instead of trying to manage history and data recovery directly, targets maintains a much lighter/friendlier data store to make it easier to use external data versioning tools instead. missed(), tracked(), deps_code(), deps_target(), deps_knitr(), deps_profile() Unsupported in targets because dependency detection is far easier to understand than in drake. drake_hpc_template_file(), drake_hpc_template_files() Deemed out of scope for targets. drake_cache(), new_cache(), find_cache(). Unsupported because targets is far more strict and paternalistic about data/file management. rescue_cache(), which_clean(), cache_planned(), cache_unplanned() Unsupported due to the simplified data management system and storage cleaning functions. drake_get_session_info() Deemed superfluous and a potential bottleneck. Discarded for targets. read_drake_seed() Superfluous because targets always uses the same global seed. tar_meta() shows all the target-level seeds. show_source() Deemed superfluous. Discarded in targets to conserve storage space in _targets/meta/meta. drake_tempfile() Superfluous in targets because there is no special disk.frame storage format. (Dynamic file targets are much better for managing disk.frames.) file_store() Superfluous in targets because all files are dynamic files and there is no longer a need to Base32-encode any file names.

The source code is here, and other examples are linked from the documentation website. 2.1 Goal of the analysis The this minimal workflow is to assess the relationship among ozone, wind, and temperature in base R’s airquality dataset. We get the data from a file, preprocess it, visualize it, fit a regression model, and generate an R Markdown report to communicate the results. 2.2 File structure The file structure of the project looks like this. ├── _targets.R ├── R/ ├──── functions.R ├── data/ └──── raw_data.csv raw_data.csv contains the data we want to analyze. Ozone,Solar.R,Wind,Temp,Month,Day 36,118,8.0,72,5,2 12,149,12.6,74,5,3 ... functions.R contains our custom user-defined functions. (See the best practices chapter for a discussion of function-oriented workflows.) # functions.R create_plot &lt;- function(data) { ggplot(data) + geom_histogram(aes(x = Ozone)) + theme_gray(24) } Both raw_data.csv and functions.R are custom components. You as the user decide whether to use them, what to name them, and where to put them. However, the “target script” _targets.R file is special. (So special, in fact, that there is a special tar_script() function to help you create one). Every targets project requires a _targets.R script in the project’s root directory to declare and configure the pipeline. Ours looks like this. # _targets.R library(targets) source(&quot;R/functions.R&quot;) options(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE) tar_option_set(packages = c(&quot;biglm&quot;, &quot;rmarkdown&quot;, &quot;tidyverse&quot;)) tar_pipeline( tar_target( raw_data_file, &quot;data/raw_data.csv&quot;, format = &quot;file&quot; ), tar_target( raw_data, read_csv(raw_data_file, col_types = cols()) ), tar_target( data, raw_data %&gt;% mutate(Ozone = replace_na(Ozone, mean(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE))) ), tar_target(hist, create_plot(data)), tar_target(fit, biglm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data)) ) All _targets.R scripts have these requirements. Load the targets package itself. (_targets.R scripts created with tar_script() automatically insert a library(targets) line at the top by default.) Load your custom functions and global objects into the R session. In our case, our only such object is the create_plot() function, and we load it into the session by calling source(\"R/functions.R\"). Call tar_option_set() to set the default settings for all you targets, such as the names of required packages and the data storage format. Individual targets can override these settings. Define individual targets with the tar_target() function. Each target is an intermediate step of the workflow. At minimum, a target must have a name and an R expression. This expression runs when the pipeline builds the target, and the return value is saved as a file in the _targets/objects/ folder. The only targets not stored in _/targets/objects/ are dynamic files such as raw_data_file. Here, format = \"file\" makes raw_data_file a dynamic file. That means targets watches the data at the file paths returned from the expression (in this case, \"data/raw_data.csv\"). Gather the targets in a pipeline with the tar_pipeline() function. tar_pipeline() is flexible: it can accept individual tar_target() objects or nested lists of such objects. Every _targets.R script must end with a tar_pipeline() object, which usually means there is an explicit call to tar_pipeline() at the very bottom. 2.3 Inspect the pipeline Before you run the pipeline for real, you should always inspect the manifest and the graph for errors. tar_manifest() shows you a data frame information about the targets, and it has functionality to specify the targets and columns returned. tar_manifest(fields = &quot;command&quot;) #&gt; # A tibble: 5 x 2 #&gt; name command #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 raw_data &quot;read_csv(raw_data_file, col_types = cols())&quot; #&gt; 2 fit &quot;biglm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data)&quot; #&gt; 3 hist &quot;create_plot(data)&quot; #&gt; 4 raw_data_fi… &quot;\\&quot;data/raw_data.csv\\&quot;&quot; #&gt; 5 data &quot;raw_data %&gt;% mutate(Ozone = replace_na(Ozone, mean(Ozone, \\\\n … There are also graphical displays with tar_glimpse() tar_glimpse() and tar_visnetwork(). tar_visnetwork() Both graphing functions above visualize the underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) and tell you how targets are connected. This DAG is indifferent to the order you write targets in tar_pipeline(). You will still get the same graph even if you rearrange them. This is because targets uses static code analysis to detect the dependencies of each target, and this process does not depend on target order. For details, visit the dependency detection section of the best practices guide. 2.4 Run the pipeline tar_make() runs the workflow. It creates a fresh clean external R process, reads _targets.R to learn about the pipeline, runs the correct targets in the correct order given by the graph, and saves the necessary data to the _targets/ data store. tar_make() #&gt; ● run target raw_data_file #&gt; ● run target raw_data #&gt; ● run target data #&gt; ● run target fit #&gt; ● run target hist The next time you run tar_make(), targets skips everything that is already up to date, which saves a lot of time in large projects with long runtimes. tar_make() #&gt; ✔ skip target raw_data_file #&gt; ✔ skip target raw_data #&gt; ✔ skip target data #&gt; ✔ skip target fit #&gt; ✔ skip target hist #&gt; ✔ Already up to date. You can use tar_visnetwork() and tar_outdated() to check ahead of time which targets are up to date. tar_visnetwork() tar_outdated() #&gt; character(0) 2.5 Changes The targets package notices when you make changes to your workflow, and tar_make() only runs the targets that need to build. There are custom rules called “cues” that targets uses to decide whether a target needs to rerun. For the full details on cues, read the “Details” section of the tar_cue() help file. (Enter ?targets::tar_cue into your R console.) 2.5.1 Change code If you change one of your functions, the targets that depend on it will no longer be up to date, and tar_make() will rebuild them. For example, let’s set the number of bins in our histogram. # Edit functions.R. create_plot &lt;- function(data) { ggplot(data) + geom_histogram(aes(x = Ozone), bins = 10) + # Set number of bins. theme_gray(24) } targets detects the change. hist is outdated (as would be any targets downstream of hist) and the others are still up to date. tar_visnetwork() tar_outdated() #&gt; [1] &quot;hist&quot; That means tar_make() reruns hist and nothing else. tar_make() #&gt; ✔ skip target raw_data_file #&gt; ✔ skip target raw_data #&gt; ✔ skip target data #&gt; ✔ skip target fit #&gt; ● run target hist We would see similar behavior if we changed the R expressions in any tar_target() calls in _targets.R. 2.5.2 Change data If we change the data file raw_data.csv, targets notices the change. This is because raw_data_file is a dynamic file (i.e. tar_target(format = \"file\")) that returned \"raw_data.csv\". Let’s try it out. Below, let’s use only the first 100 rows of the airquality dataset. write_csv(head(airquality, n = 100), &quot;data/raw_data.csv&quot;) Sure enough, raw_data_file and everything downstream is out of date, so all our targets are outdated. tar_visnetwork() tar_outdated() #&gt; [1] &quot;raw_data&quot; &quot;fit&quot; &quot;hist&quot; &quot;raw_data_file&quot; #&gt; [5] &quot;data&quot; tar_make() #&gt; ● run target raw_data_file #&gt; ● run target raw_data #&gt; ● run target data #&gt; ● run target fit #&gt; ● run target hist 2.6 Read your data targets has a convenient functions tar_read() to read your data from the _targets/ data store. tar_read(hist) There is also a tar_load() function, which supports tidyselect verbs like starts_with() tar_load(starts_with(&quot;fit&quot;)) library(biglm) #&gt; Loading required package: DBI fit #&gt; Large data regression model: biglm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data) #&gt; Sample size = 100 The purpose of tar_read() and tar_load() is to make exploratory data analysis easy and convenient. Use these functions to verify the correctness of the output from the pipeline and come up with ideas for new targets if needed. 2.7 Read metadata To read the build progress of your targets while tar_make() is running, you can open a new R session and run tar_progress(). It reads the spreadsheet in _targets/meta/progress and tells you which targets are running, built, errored, or cancelled. as.data.frame(tar_progress()) #&gt; name progress #&gt; 1 raw_data_file built #&gt; 2 raw_data built #&gt; 3 data built #&gt; 4 fit built #&gt; 5 hist built Likewise, the tar_meta() function reads _targets/meta/meta and tells you high-level information about the target’s settings, data, and results. The warnings, error, and traceback columns give you diagnostic information about targets with problems. as.data.frame(tar_meta()) #&gt; name type data command depend #&gt; 1 create_plot function 658f2a44b31f63bb &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; #&gt; 2 raw_data_file stem 2b16f490030787ce b6df0c34fc22d1b9 ef46db3751d8e999 #&gt; 3 raw_data stem 81f24e414a848be0 000ed0cc054f0d35 6ef08fe7f06c82ac #&gt; 4 data stem 1e1d6c4923db1fa9 df3101ce91c63e21 1e037ea6a50b00ac #&gt; 5 fit stem d01f8b0736dde4fe aa0df6c5dbd10537 fb68e10410f0f3c8 #&gt; 6 hist stem 68c45d373f81c549 68877181ab74e51e 39b2e88285ec367d #&gt; seed path time size bytes #&gt; 1 NA NA &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; NA #&gt; 2 2110307107 data/raw_data.csv 09e1eebeacd2d2f9 9fb65f8dffe0153b 1884 #&gt; 3 -979620141 _targets/objects/raw_data 1e635fd988109aaa 029e3f18865b911c 1152 #&gt; 4 1588979285 _targets/objects/data 6fa8095ebdae2171 a744f0f8f0be9d70 1156 #&gt; 5 1780184594 _targets/objects/fit 3ab68d7827354d48 31f6a3e6158ce3a3 1608 #&gt; 6 -1026346201 _targets/objects/hist 89280bc0088eb234 631abafa35c3f47a 44325 #&gt; format iteration parent children seconds warnings error #&gt; 1 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; NA NA NA NA NA #&gt; 2 file vector NA NA 1.391 NA NA #&gt; 3 rds vector NA NA 0.036 NA NA #&gt; 4 rds vector NA NA 0.014 NA NA #&gt; 5 rds vector NA NA 0.003 NA NA #&gt; 6 rds vector NA NA 0.013 NA NA The _targets/meta/meta spreadsheet file is critically important. Although targets can still work properly if files are missing from _targets/objects, the pipeline will error out if _targets/meta/meta is corrupted. If tar_meta() works, the project should be fine. "],["practice.html", "Chapter 3 Best practices for targets-powered projects 3.1 A move away from imperative scripts 3.2 Functions 3.3 Packages 3.4 Targets 3.5 Dependencies 3.6 Debugging 3.7 Performance", " Chapter 3 Best practices for targets-powered projects The targets package espouses a clean, organized, modular, function-oriented style of programming. Many data scientists and researchers initially find this style uncomfortable, not only because it can be unfamiliar, but also because may requires us to postpone our thinking about actual results and conclusions while we focus on the process of creating a new workflow. However, this up-front cost pays off. Data science projects become easier to extend, maintain, and share with collaborators, and they have longer shelf lives than otherwise. In other words, we increase reproducibility while decreasing technical debt. Once these patterns become habits, the pace of development quickens while still lending more trust and credibility to the results. 3.1 A move away from imperative scripts Traditional data analysis projects are usually coded as collections of imperative scripts, often with numeric prefixes. 01-data.R 02-preprocess.R 03-analysis.R 04-summaries.R This approach does not scale well in large, cumbersome projects. Code gets tangled, messy, and difficult to test. Results fail to keep pace with rapid development, and reproducibility suffers. 3.2 Functions Functions are the most idiomatic way to express the modularity we need. They are custom shorthand that makes code easier to read and easier to test. A good pure function has An informative name that describes what the function does. Input arguments that are easy to generate. A return value that is convenient to introspect and meaningful to the project. is the shorthand, and (2) and (3) make testing easier. In data science workflows, we typically write individual functions to Retrieve or generate a dataset. Preprocess a dataset. Fit a model to a preprocessed dataset. Generate machine-readable summaries of the model fit (tables of summary statistics). Generate human-readable summaries of the model fit (plots and reports). Each of the functions in (1)-(5) typically calls custom inner functions to increase modularity even further. For examples, see the functions.R files in the example projects listed here. 3.3 Packages When it comes time to decide which targets to rerun or skip, the default behavior is to ignore changes to external R packages. Usually, local package libraries do not need to change very often, and it is best to maintain a reproducible project library using renv. However, there are some situations where it makes sense to watch a package for changes. For example, you could be in the middle of developing a methodology package that serves as the focus of the pipeline, or you could implement the workflow itself as a package. In either case, you can tell targets to track changes using the imports argument to tar_option_set(). If you write tar_option_set(imports = \"package1\") in _targets.R, then targets will analyze the R objects in package1 and automatically rerun the dependent targets when these objects change. These tracked objects include unexported functions internal to the package. You can track multiple packages this way, e.g. tar_option_set(imports = c(\"package1\", \"package2\")). In this case, the contents of package1 override those of package2 when there are name conflicts. Likewise, tar_option_get(\"envir\") (usually the global environment) overrides both. 3.4 Targets Targets are imperative high-level steps of the workflow that run the work you define in your functions. Like functions, targets generally focus on datasets, analyses, and summaries. The targets package automatically skips targets that are already up to date, so you should strive to define targets that maximize time savings. Good targets usually Are large enough to subtract a decent amount of runtime when skipped. Are small enough that some targets can be skipped even if others need to run. Invoke no side effects such as modifications to the global environment. (But targets with tar_target(format = \"file\") can save files.) Return a single value that is Easy to understand and introspect. Meaningful to the project. Easy to save as a file, e.g. with readRDS(). Regarding the last point above, it is possible to customize the storage format of the target. For details, enter ?tar_target in the console and scroll down to the description of the format argument. 3.5 Dependencies Adept pipeline construction requires an understanding of dependency detection. To identify the targets and global objects that each target depends on, the targets package uses static code analysis with codetools, and you can emulate this process with tar_deps(). Let us look at the dependencies of the raw_data target. tar_deps(function() { read_csv(raw_data_file, col_types = cols()) }) #&gt; [1] &quot;{&quot; &quot;cols&quot; &quot;raw_data_file&quot; &quot;read_csv&quot; The raw_data target depends on target raw_data_file because the command for raw_data mentions the symbol raw_data_file. Similarly, if we were to create a user-defined read_csv() function, the raw_data target would also depend on read_csv() and any other user-defined global functions and objects nested inside read_csv(). Changes to any of these objects would cause the raw_data target to rerun on the next tar_make(). Not all of the objects from tar_deps() actually register as dependencies. When it comes to detecting dependencies, targets only recognizes Other targets (such as raw_data_file). Functions and objects in the main environment. This environment is almost always the global environment of the R process that runs _targets.R, so these dependencies are usually going to be the custom functions and objects you write yourself. This process excludes many objects from dependency detection. For example, both { and cols() are excluded because they are defined in the environments of packages (base and readr, respectively). Functions and objects from packages are ignored unless you supply a package environment to the envir argument of tar_option_set() when you call it in _targets.R, e.g. tar_option_set(envir = getNamespace(\"packageName\")). You should only set envir if you write your own package to contain your whole data analysis project. 3.6 Debugging If one of your targets fails, first look up the error message in tar_meta(). If that does not help, try one of the following techniques. 3.6.1 Workspaces Workspaces are special lightweight reference files that allow tar_workspace() to recreate the runtime environment of a target. This lets you troubleshoot issues outside the pipeline in an interactive session. There are two ways to save a workspace file: Set error = \"workspace\" in tar_option_set() or tar_target(). Then, tar_make() and friends will save a workspace file for every target that errors out. In the workspaces argument of tar_option_set(), specify the targets for which you want to save workspaces. Then, run tar_make() or similar. A workspace file will be saved for each existing target, regardless of whether the target runs or gets skipped in the pipeline. Here is an example of (1). # _targets.R file: options(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE) library(targets) library(tidyverse) options(crayon.enabled = FALSE) tar_option_set(error = &quot;workspace&quot;) f &lt;- function(x) { stopifnot(x &lt; 4) } tar_pipeline( tar_target(x, seq_len(4)), tar_target(y, f(x), pattern = map(x)) # The branching chapter describes patterns. ) # R console: tar_make() #&gt; ● run target x #&gt; ● run branch y_29239c8a #&gt; ● run branch y_7cc32924 #&gt; ● run branch y_bd602d50 #&gt; ● run branch y_05f206d7 #&gt; x error branch y_05f206d7 #&gt; ● save workspace y_05f206d7 #&gt; Error : x &lt; 4 is not TRUE . #&gt; Error: callr subprocess failed: x &lt; 4 is not TRUE . One of the y_******* targets errored out. failed &lt;- tar_meta(fields = error) %&gt;% na.omit() %&gt;% pull(name) print(failed) #&gt; [1] &quot;y_05f206d7&quot; tar_workspace() reads the special metadata in the workspace file and then loads the target’s dependencies from various locations in _targets/objects and/or the cloud. It also sets the random number generator seed to the seed of the target, loads the required packages, and runs _targets.R to load other global object dependencies such as functions. tar_workspace(y_05f206d7) We now have the dependencies of y_05f206d7 in memory, which allows you to try out any failed function calls interactively. print(x) #&gt; [1] 4 f(x) #&gt; Error in f(x) : x &lt; 4 is not TRUE In addition, current random number generator seed (.Random.seed) is also the value y_05f206d7 started with. Remove all workspace files with: tar_destroy(destroy = &quot;workspaces&quot;) 3.6.2 Interactive debugging Interactive debugging is a way to troubleshoot targets without saving or loading workspace files. Here are the steps. In _targets.R, write a call to tar_option_set() with debug equal to the target name. Consider also setting cue equal to tar_cue(mode = \"never\") so tar_make() reaches the target you want to debug more quickly. Launch a fresh clean new interactive R session with the _targets.R script in your working directory. Run targets::tar_make() (or targets::tar_make_clustermq(), or targets::tar_make_future()) with callr_function = NULL. When targets reaches the target you selected to debug, your R session will start an interactive debugger, and you should see Browse[1]&gt; in your console. Run targets::tar_name() to verify that you are debugging the correct target. Interactively run any R code that helps you troubleshoot the problem.1 To try it out yourself, write the following _targets.R file. # _targets.R library(targets) tar_option_set(debug = &quot;b&quot;) f &lt;- function(x) x + 1 tar_pipeline( tar_target(a, 1), tar_target(b, f(a)) ) Then, call tar_make(callr_function = NULL) to drop into a debugger at the command of b. # R console tar_make(callr_function = NULL) #&gt; ● run target a #&gt; ● run target b #&gt; Called from: eval(expr, envir) Browse[1]&gt; When the debugger launches, run targets::tar_name() to confirm you are running the correct target. Browse[1]&gt; targets::tar_name() #&gt; [1] &quot;b&quot; In the debugger, the dependency targets of b are available in the current environment, and the global objects and functions are available in the parent environment. Browse[1]&gt; ls() #&gt; [1] &quot;a&quot; Browse[1]&gt; a #&gt; [1] 1 Browse[1]&gt; ls(parent.env(environment())) #&gt; [1] &quot;f&quot; Browse[1]&gt; f(1) #&gt; [1] 2 Press n or c to advance to the next line or breakpoint. Browse[1]&gt; n &gt; For more on debugging R code, visit this page. 3.7 Performance If your pipeline has several thousand targets, functions like tar_make(), tar_outdated(), and tar_visnetwork() may take longer to run. There is an inevitable per-target runtime cost because package needs to check the code and data of each target individually. If this overhead becomes too much, consider batching your work into a smaller group of heavier targets. Using your custom functions, you can make each target perform multiple iterations of a task that was previously given to targets one at a time. For details and an example, please see the discussion on batching at the bottom of the dynamic branching chapter. Alternatively, if you see slowness in your project, you can contribute to the package with a profiling study. These contributions are great because they help improve the package. Here are the recommended steps. Install the proffer R package and its dependencies. Run proffer::pprof(tar_make(callr_function = NULL)) on your project. When a web browser pops up with pprof, select the flame graph and screenshot it. Post the flame graph, along with any code and data you can share, to the targets package issue tracker. The maintainer will have a look and try to make the package faster for your use case if speedups are possible. Because of the way targets manages environments, ls() will not report all your global objects, but you should still be able to access them.↩︎ "],["files.html", "Chapter 4 External files and literate programming 4.1 Internal files 4.2 External input files 4.3 External output files 4.4 Literate programming", " Chapter 4 External files and literate programming The targets package automatically stores data and automatically responds to changed files to keep your targets up to date. The chapter below explains how to leverage this reproducibility for external datasets, external output files, and literate programming artifacts such as R Markdown reports. Real-world applications of these techniques are linked from here. 4.1 Internal files Each project’s data lives in the _targets/ folder in the root directory (where you call tar_make()). The files in the _targets/ look like this: _targets/ ├── meta/ ├────── progress ├────── meta ├── objects/ ├────── target1 ├────── target2 ├────── branching_target_c7bcb4bd ├────── branching_target_285fb6a9 ├────── branching_target_874ca381 └── scratch/ # tar_make() deletes this folder after it finishes. Spreadsheets _targets/meta/meta and _targets/meta_progress keep track of target metadata, and the scratch/ directory contains temporary files which can be safely deleted after tar_make() finishes. The _targets/objects/ folder contains the return values of the targets themselves. A typical target returns an R object: for example, a dataset with tar_target(dataset, data.frame(x = rnorm(1000)), format = \"fst\") or a fitted model tar_target(model, biglm(ozone ~ temp + wind), format = \"qs\"). When you run the pipeline, targets computes this object and saves it as a file in _targets/objects/. The file name in _targets/objects/ is always the target name, and type of the file is determined by the format argument of tar_target(), and formats \"fst\" and \"qs\" are two of many choices explained in the help file of tar_target(). No matter what format you pick, targets watches the file for changes and recomputes the target in tar_make() if the the file gets corrupted (unless you suppress the file cue with tar_target(cue = tar_cue(file = FALSE))). 4.2 External input files To reproducibly track an external input file, you need to define a new target and choose format = \"file\" in tar_target(). Targets with the \"file\" format are called dynamic files, and these targets are unusual because their return values do not get saved in the _targets/objects/ folder. Rather, they expect you to return a character vector files and directories, which gets stored in the _targets/meta spreadsheet, and then targets watches the data at those paths for changes. The first two targets of the minimal example demonstrate this technique. tar_script({ path_to_data &lt;- function() { &quot;data/raw_data.csv&quot; } tar_pipeline( tar_target( raw_data_file, path_to_data(), format = &quot;file&quot; ), tar_target( raw_data, read_csv(raw_data_file, col_types = cols()) ) ) }) Above, raw_data_file is the dynamic file target. The file data/raw_data.csv exists before we ever run the pipeline, and the R expresion for the target returns the character vector \"data/raw_data.csv\". (We use the path_to_data() function to demonstrate that you need not literally write \"data/raw_data.csv\" as long as the path is returned somehow.) All subsequent targets that depend on the file must reference the file using the symbol raw_data_file. This allows targets’ automatic static code analysis routines to detect which targets depend on the file. Because the raw_data target literally mentions the symbol raw_data_file, targets knows raw_data depends on raw_data_file. This ensures that raw_data_file gets processed before raw_data, and tar_make() automatically reruns raw_data if raw_data_file or \"data/raw_data.csv\" change. tar_visnetwork() If we were to omit the symbol raw_data_file from the R expression of raw_data, those targets would be disconnected in the graph and tar_make() would make incorrect decisions. tar_script({ path_to_data &lt;- function() { &quot;data/raw_data.csv&quot; } tar_pipeline( tar_target( raw_data_file, path_to_data(), format = &quot;file&quot; ), tar_target( raw_data, read_csv(&quot;data/raw_data.csv&quot;, col_types = cols()) # incorrect ) ) }) tar_visnetwork() 4.3 External output files We can generate and track custom external files too, and the mechanics are similar. We still return a file path and use format = \"file\", but this time, our R command writes a file before it returns a path. For an external plot file, our target might look like this. tar_target( plot_file, save_plot_and_return_path(), format = &quot;file&quot; ) where our custom save_plot_and_return_path() function does exactly what the name describes. save_plot_and_return_path &lt;- function() { plot &lt;- ggplot(mtcars) + geom_point(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) ggsave(&quot;plot_file.png&quot;, plot, width = 7, height = 7) return(&quot;plot_file.png&quot;) } 4.4 Literate programming R Markdown reports are a little more challenging because they often depend on upstream targets. To integrate an R Markdown report with a targets pipeline, you must use tar_read() and tar_load() in active code chunks to explicitly name the targets that the report depends on. (Do not use tar_read_raw() or tar_load_raw() for this.) The report from the minimal example looks like this. Above, the report depends on targets fit and hist. The use of tar_read() and tar_load() allows us to run the report outside the pipeline. (Again, do not use tar_read_raw() or tar_load_raw() for this.) As long as _targets/ folder has data on the required targets from a previous tar_make(), you can open the RStudio IDE, edit the report, and click the Knit button like you would for any other R Markdown report. To connect the target with the pipeline, we define a special kind of target using tar_render() from the tarchetypes package instead of the usual tar_target(), which Finds all the tar_load()/tar_read() dependencies in the report and inserts them into the target’s command. This enforces the proper dependency relationships. (tar_load_raw() and tar_read_raw() are ignored because those dependencies cannot be resolved with static code analysis.) Sets format = \"file\" (see tar_target()) so targets watches the files at the returned paths. Configures the target’s command to return both the output report files and the input source file. All these file paths are relative paths so the project stays portable. Forces the report to run in the user’s current working directory instead of the working directory of the report. Sets convenient default options such as deployment = \"main\" in tar_target() and quiet = TRUE in rmarkdown::render(). The target definition looks like this. library(tarchetypes) tar_render(report, &quot;report.Rmd&quot;) #&gt; &lt;stem target&gt; #&gt; name: report #&gt; command: #&gt; tarchetypes::tar_render_run(path = &quot;report.Rmd&quot;, args = list(input = &quot;report.Rmd&quot;, #&gt; knit_root_dir = getwd(), quiet = TRUE), deps = list(fit, #&gt; hist)) #&gt; format: file #&gt; iteration method: vector #&gt; error mode: stop #&gt; memory mode: persistent #&gt; storage mode: main #&gt; retrieval mode: main #&gt; deploy to: main #&gt; resources: #&gt; list() #&gt; cue: #&gt; mode: thorough #&gt; command: TRUE #&gt; depend: TRUE #&gt; format: TRUE #&gt; iteration: TRUE #&gt; file: TRUE #&gt; packages: #&gt; tarchetypes #&gt; biglm #&gt; DBI #&gt; withr #&gt; forcats #&gt; stringr #&gt; dplyr #&gt; purrr #&gt; readr #&gt; tidyr #&gt; tibble #&gt; ggplot2 #&gt; tidyverse #&gt; targets #&gt; fs #&gt; stats #&gt; graphics #&gt; grDevices #&gt; utils #&gt; datasets #&gt; methods #&gt; base #&gt; library: #&gt; NULL Because symbols fit and hist appear in the command, targets knows that report depends on fit and hist. When we put the report target in the pipeline, these dependency relationships show up in the graph. # _targets.R library(targets) library(tarchetypes) source(&quot;R/functions.R&quot;) tar_pipeline( tar_target( raw_data_file, &quot;data/raw_data.csv&quot;, format = &quot;file&quot; ), tar_target( raw_data, read_csv(raw_data_file, col_types = cols()) ), tar_target( data, raw_data %&gt;% mutate(Ozone = replace_na(Ozone, mean(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE))) ), tar_target(hist, create_plot(data)), tar_target(fit, biglm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data)), tar_render(report, &quot;report.Rmd&quot;) # Here is our call to tar_render(). ) tar_visnetwork() 4.4.1 Parameterized R Markdown tarchetypes::tar_render() supports parameterized R Markdown, and parameters can be values of upstream targets in the pipeline. In the following pipeline: # _targets.R library(targets) library(tarchetypes) tar_pipeline( tar_target(data, data.frame(x = seq_len(26), y = letters)) tar_render(report, &quot;report.Rmd&quot;, params = list(your_param = data)) ) the report target will run: rmarkdown::render(&quot;report.Rmd&quot;, params = list(your_param = your_target)) where report.Rmd has the following YAML front matter: --- title: report output_format: html_document params: your_param: &quot;default value&quot; --- and the following code chunk: print(params$your_param) See these examples for a demonstration. "],["dynamic.html", "Chapter 5 Dynamic branching 5.1 Patterns 5.2 Pattern construction 5.3 Dynamic branching over files 5.4 Iteration 5.5 Batching", " Chapter 5 Dynamic branching The targets packages supports shorthand to create large pipelines. Dynamic branching defines new targets (i.e. branches) while the pipeline is running, and those definitions can be based on prior results from upstream targets. Relative to static branching, dynamic branching is better suited to iterating over a larger number of very similar tasks (but can act as an inner layer inside static branching, as the next chapter demonstrates). 5.1 Patterns To use dynamic branching, set the pattern argument of tar_target(). A pattern is a dynamic branching specification expressed in terms of functional programming. The following minimal example explores the mechanics of patterns (and examples of branching in real-world projects are linked from here). library(targets) library(tidyverse) tar_script({ options(crayon.enabled = FALSE, tidyverse.quiet = TRUE) tar_pipeline( tar_target(w, c(1, 2)), tar_target(x, c(10, 20)), tar_target(y, w + x, pattern = map(w, x)), tar_target(z, sum(y)), tar_target(z2, length(y), pattern = map(y)) ) }) tar_visnetwork() tar_make() #&gt; ● run target w #&gt; ● run target x #&gt; ● run branch y_61ced14d #&gt; ● run branch y_4096b6a8 #&gt; ● run branch z2_275d234a #&gt; ● run branch z2_8c730b35 #&gt; ● run target z Above, targets w, x, and z are called stems because they provide values for other targets to branch over. Target y is a pattern because it defines multiple sub-targets, or branches, based on the return values of the targets named inside map() or cross(). If we read target y into memory, all the branches will load and get aggregated according to the iteration argument of tar_target(). tar_read(y) #&gt; [1] 11 22 Target z accepts this entire aggregate of y and sums it. tar_read(z) #&gt; [1] 33 Target z2 maps over y, so each each branch of z2 accepts a branch of y. tar_read(z2) #&gt; [1] 1 1 5.2 Pattern construction targets supports the following pattern types. map(): iterate over one or more targets in sequence. cross(): iterate over combinations of slices of targets. head(): restrict branching to the first few elements. tail(): restrict branching to the last few elements. sample(): restrict branching to a random subset of elements. These patterns are composable. Below, target z creates six branches, one for each combination of w and (x, y) pair. The pattern cross(w, map(x, y)) is equivalent to tidyr::crossing(w, tidyr::nesting(x, y)). tar_script({ options(crayon.enabled = FALSE) tar_pipeline( tar_target(w_comp, seq_len(2)), tar_target(x_comp, head(letters, 3)), tar_target(y_comp, head(LETTERS, 3)), tar_target( z_comp, data.frame(w = w_comp, x = x_comp, y = y_comp), pattern = cross(w_comp, map(x_comp, y_comp)) ) ) }) tar_make() #&gt; ● run target w_comp #&gt; ● run target x_comp #&gt; ● run target y_comp #&gt; ● run branch z_comp_a601a6f3 #&gt; ● run branch z_comp_38222c1e #&gt; ● run branch z_comp_b9220de4 #&gt; ● run branch z_comp_c3fe35d0 #&gt; ● run branch z_comp_1a64d49a #&gt; ● run branch z_comp_7cbac5ae tar_read(z_comp) #&gt; w x y #&gt; 1 1 a A #&gt; 2 1 b B #&gt; 3 1 c C #&gt; 4 2 a A #&gt; 5 2 b B #&gt; 6 2 c C To check the correctness of a pattern without running the pipeline, use tar_pattern(). Simply supply the pattern itself and the length of each dependency target. The branch names in the data frames below are made up, but they convey a high-level picture of the branching structure. tar_pattern( cross(w_comp, map(x_comp, y_comp)), w_comp = 2, x_comp = 3, y_comp = 3 ) #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 3 #&gt; w_comp x_comp y_comp #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 w_comp_1 x_comp_1 y_comp_1 #&gt; 2 w_comp_1 x_comp_2 y_comp_2 #&gt; 3 w_comp_1 x_comp_3 y_comp_3 #&gt; 4 w_comp_2 x_comp_1 y_comp_1 #&gt; 5 w_comp_2 x_comp_2 y_comp_2 #&gt; 6 w_comp_2 x_comp_3 y_comp_3 tar_pattern( head(cross(w_comp, map(x_comp, y_comp)), n = 2), w_comp = 2, x_comp = 3, y_comp = 3 ) #&gt; # A tibble: 2 x 3 #&gt; w_comp x_comp y_comp #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 w_comp_1 x_comp_1 y_comp_1 #&gt; 2 w_comp_1 x_comp_2 y_comp_2 tar_pattern( cross(w_comp, sample(map(x_comp, y_comp), n = 2)), w_comp = 2, x_comp = 3, y_comp = 3 ) #&gt; # A tibble: 4 x 3 #&gt; w_comp x_comp y_comp #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 w_comp_1 x_comp_2 y_comp_2 #&gt; 2 w_comp_1 x_comp_1 y_comp_1 #&gt; 3 w_comp_2 x_comp_2 y_comp_2 #&gt; 4 w_comp_2 x_comp_1 y_comp_1 5.3 Dynamic branching over files Dynamic branching over files is tricky. A target with format = \"file\" treats the entire set of files as an irreducible bundle. That means in order to branch over files downstream, each file must already have its own branch. tar_pipeline( tar_target(paths, c(&quot;a.csv&quot;, &quot;b.csv&quot;)), tar_target(files, paths, format = &quot;file&quot;, pattern = map(paths)), tar_target(data, read_csv(files), pattern = map(files)) ) The tar_files() function from the tarchetypes package is shorthand for the first two targets above. library(tarchetypes) tar_pipeline( tar_files(files, c(&quot;a.csv&quot;, &quot;b.csv&quot;)), tar_target(data, read_csv(files), pattern = map(files)) ) 5.4 Iteration There are many ways to slice up a stem for branching, and there are many ways to aggregate the branches of a pattern.2 The iteration argument of tar_target() controls the splitting and aggregation protocol on a target-by-target basis, and you can set the default for all targets with the analogous argument of tar_option_set(). 5.4.1 Vector targets uses vector iteration by default, and you can opt into this behavior by setting iteration = \"vector\" in tar_target(). In vector iteration, targets uses the vctrs package to split stems and aggregate banches. That means vctrs::vec_slice() slices up stems like x for mapping, and vctrs::vec_c() aggregates patterns like y for operations like tar_read(). For atomic vectors like in the example above, this behavior is already intuitive. But if we map over a data frame, each branch will get a row of the data frame due to vector iteration. tar_script({ options(crayon.enabled = FALSE, tidyverse.quiet = TRUE) print_and_return &lt;- function(x) { print(x) x } tar_pipeline( tar_target(x, data.frame(a = c(1, 2), b = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;))), tar_target(y, print_and_return(x), pattern = map(x)) ) }) tar_make() #&gt; ● run target x #&gt; ● run branch y_2e131731 #&gt; a b #&gt; 1 1 a #&gt; ● run branch y_6c3b7977 #&gt; a b #&gt; 1 2 b And since y also has iteration = \"vector\", the aggregate of y is a single data frame of all the rows. tar_read(y) #&gt; a b #&gt; 1 1 a #&gt; 2 2 b 5.4.2 List List iteration splits and aggregates targets as simple lists. If target x has \"list\" iteration, all branches of downstream patterns will get x[[1]], x[[2]], and so on. (vctrs::vec_slice() behaves more like [] than [[]].) tar_script({ options(crayon.enabled = FALSE, tidyverse.quiet = TRUE) print_and_return &lt;- function(x) { print(x) x } tar_pipeline( tar_target( x, data.frame(a = c(1, 2), b = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)), iteration = &quot;list&quot; ), tar_target(y, print_and_return(x), pattern = map(x)), tar_target(z, x, pattern = map(x), iteration = &quot;list&quot;) ) }) tar_make() #&gt; ● run target x #&gt; ● run branch y_651b13c7 #&gt; [1] 1 2 #&gt; ● run branch y_1c8c7726 #&gt; [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; #&gt; ● run branch z_651b13c7 #&gt; ● run branch z_1c8c7726 Aggregation also happens differently. In this case, the vector iteration in y is not ideal, and the list iteration in z gives us more sensible output. tar_read(y) #&gt; Error: Can&#39;t combine `..1` &lt;double&gt; and `..2` &lt;character&gt;. tar_read(z) #&gt; [[1]] #&gt; [1] 1 2 #&gt; #&gt; [[2]] #&gt; [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; 5.4.3 Group Group iteration brings dplyr::group_by() functionality to patterns. This way, we can map or cross over custom subsets of rows. Consider the following data frame. object &lt;- data.frame( x = seq_len(6), id = rep(letters[seq_len(3)], each = 2) ) object #&gt; x id #&gt; 1 1 a #&gt; 2 2 a #&gt; 3 3 b #&gt; 4 4 b #&gt; 5 5 c #&gt; 6 6 c To map over the groups of rows defined by the id column, we Use group_by() and tar_group() to define the groups of rows, and Use iteration = \"group\" in tar_target() to tell downstream patterns to use the row groups. Put together, the pipeline looks like this. tar_script({ options(crayon.enabled = FALSE, tidyverse.quiet = TRUE) tar_option_set(packages = &quot;tidyverse&quot;) tar_pipeline( tar_target( data, data.frame( x = seq_len(6), id = rep(letters[seq_len(3)], each = 2) ) %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% tar_group(), iteration = &quot;group&quot; ), tar_target( subsets, data, pattern = map(data), iteration = &quot;list&quot; ) ) }) tar_make() #&gt; ● run target data #&gt; ● run branch subsets_9c27c3ec #&gt; ● run branch subsets_8c545d52 #&gt; ● run branch subsets_2babc46e lapply(tar_read(subsets), as.data.frame) #&gt; [[1]] #&gt; x id tar_group #&gt; 1 1 a 1 #&gt; 2 2 a 1 #&gt; #&gt; [[2]] #&gt; x id tar_group #&gt; 1 3 b 2 #&gt; 2 4 b 2 #&gt; #&gt; [[3]] #&gt; x id tar_group #&gt; 1 5 c 3 #&gt; 2 6 c 3 Row groups are defined in the special tar_group column created by tar_group(). data.frame( x = seq_len(6), id = rep(letters[seq_len(3)], each = 2) ) %&gt;% dplyr::group_by(id) %&gt;% tar_group() #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 3 #&gt; # Groups: id [3] #&gt; x id tar_group #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; #&gt; 1 1 a 1 #&gt; 2 2 a 1 #&gt; 3 3 b 2 #&gt; 4 4 b 2 #&gt; 5 5 c 3 #&gt; 6 6 c 3 tar_group() creates this column based on the orderings of the grouping variables supplied to dplyr::group_by(), not the order of the rows in the data. flip_order &lt;- function(x) { ordered(x, levels = sort(unique(x), decreasing = TRUE)) } data.frame( x = seq_len(6), id = flip_order(rep(letters[seq_len(3)], each = 2)) ) %&gt;% dplyr::group_by(id) %&gt;% tar_group() #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 3 #&gt; # Groups: id [3] #&gt; x id tar_group #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;int&gt; #&gt; 1 1 a 3 #&gt; 2 2 a 3 #&gt; 3 3 b 2 #&gt; 4 4 b 2 #&gt; 5 5 c 1 #&gt; 6 6 c 1 The ordering in tar_group agrees with the ordering shown by dplyr::group_keys(). data.frame( x = seq_len(6), id = flip_order(rep(letters[seq_len(3)], each = 2)) ) %&gt;% dplyr::group_by(id) %&gt;% dplyr::group_keys() #&gt; # A tibble: 3 x 1 #&gt; id #&gt; * &lt;ord&gt; #&gt; 1 c #&gt; 2 b #&gt; 3 a Branches are arranged in increasing order with respect to the integers in tar_group. tar_script({ options(crayon.enabled = FALSE, tidyverse.quiet = TRUE) tar_option_set(packages = &quot;tidyverse&quot;) flip_order &lt;- function(x) { ordered(x, levels = sort(unique(x), decreasing = TRUE)) } tar_pipeline( tar_target( data, data.frame( x = seq_len(6), id = flip_order(rep(letters[seq_len(3)], each = 2)) ) %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% tar_group(), iteration = &quot;group&quot; ), tar_target( subsets, data, pattern = map(data), iteration = &quot;list&quot; ) ) }) tar_make() #&gt; ● run target data #&gt; ● run branch subsets_9249dc2d #&gt; ● run branch subsets_5125c804 #&gt; ● run branch subsets_a50321ad lapply(tar_read(subsets), as.data.frame) #&gt; [[1]] #&gt; x id tar_group #&gt; 1 5 c 1 #&gt; 2 6 c 1 #&gt; #&gt; [[2]] #&gt; x id tar_group #&gt; 1 3 b 2 #&gt; 2 4 b 2 #&gt; #&gt; [[3]] #&gt; x id tar_group #&gt; 1 1 a 3 #&gt; 2 2 a 3 5.5 Batching With dynamic branching, it is super easy to create an enormous number of targets. But when the number of targets starts to exceed a couple hundred, tar_make() slows down, and graphs from tar_visnetwork() start to become unmanageable. If that happens to you, consider batching your work into a smaller number of targets. The targets-stan repository has an excellent example of batching. The goal of the pipeline is to validate a Bayesian model by simulating thousands of dataset, analyzing each with a Bayesian model, and assessing the overall accuracy of the inference. Rather than define a target for each dataset in model, the pipeline breaks up the work into batches, where each batch has multiple datasets or multiple analyses. Here is a version of the pipeline with 40 batches and 25 simulation reps per batch (1000 reps total in a pipeline of 82 targets). tar_pipeline( tar_target(model_file, compile_model(&quot;stan/model.stan&quot;), format = &quot;file&quot;), tar_target(index_batch, seq_len(40)), tar_target(index_sim, seq_len(25)), tar_target( data_continuous, purrr::map_dfr(index_sim, ~simulate_data_continuous()), pattern = map(index_batch) ), tar_target( fit_continuous, map_sims(data_continuous, model_file = model_file), pattern = map(data_continuous) ) ) Slicing is always the same when we branch over an existing pattern. If we have tar_target(y, x, pattern = map(x)) and x is another pattern, then each branch of y always gets a branch of x regardless of the iteration method. Likewise, the aggregation of stems does not depend on the iteration method because every stem is already aggregated.↩︎ "],["static.html", "Chapter 6 Static branching 6.1 Map 6.2 Combine 6.3 Metaprogram", " Chapter 6 Static branching The targets packages supports shorthand to create large pipelines. Static branching creates batches of targets up front before the pipeline runs. Static branching is not designed for the kind of volume that dynamic branching can handle, but it is more flexible when the targets are heterogeneous. 6.1 Map tar_map() from the tarchetypes package creates copies of existing target objects, where each new command is a variation on the original. In the example below, we have a data analysis workflow that iterates over datasets and analysis methods.

And for more combinations of settings, use tidyr::expand_grid() on values. # _targets.R file: library(targets) library(tarchetypes) library(tidyr) values &lt;- expand_grid( # Use all possible combinations of input settings. method_function = rlang::syms(c(&quot;method1&quot;, &quot;method2&quot;)), data_source = c(&quot;NIH&quot;, &quot;NIAID&quot;) ) targets &lt;- tar_map( values = values, names = &quot;data_source&quot;, # Select columns from `values` for target names. tar_target(analysis, method_function(data_source, reps = 10)), tar_target(summary, summarize_analysis(analysis, data_source)) ) tar_pipeline(targets) tar_manifest() #&gt; # A tibble: 8 x 3 #&gt; name command pattern #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 analysis_NIAID_1 &quot;method2(\\&quot;NIAID\\&quot;, reps = 10)&quot; &lt;NA&gt; #&gt; 2 summary_NIAID &quot;summarize_analysis(analysis_NIAID, \\&quot;NIAID\\&quot;)&quot; &lt;NA&gt; #&gt; 3 summary_NIH_1 &quot;summarize_analysis(analysis_NIH_1, \\&quot;NIH\\&quot;)&quot; &lt;NA&gt; #&gt; 4 analysis_NIH &quot;method1(\\&quot;NIH\\&quot;, reps = 10)&quot; &lt;NA&gt; #&gt; 5 summary_NIAID_1 &quot;summarize_analysis(analysis_NIAID_1, \\&quot;NIAID\\&quot;)&quot; &lt;NA&gt; #&gt; 6 analysis_NIAID &quot;method1(\\&quot;NIAID\\&quot;, reps = 10)&quot; &lt;NA&gt; #&gt; 7 analysis_NIH_1 &quot;method2(\\&quot;NIH\\&quot;, reps = 10)&quot; &lt;NA&gt; #&gt; 8 summary_NIH &quot;summarize_analysis(analysis_NIH, \\&quot;NIH\\&quot;)&quot; &lt;NA&gt; # You may need to zoom out on this interactive graph to see all 8 targets. tar_visnetwork(targets_only = TRUE) You can even combine together static and dynamic branching. The static tar_map() is an excellent outer layer on top of targets with patterns. The following is a sketch of a pipeline that runs each of two data analysis methods 10 times, once per random seed. Static branching iterates over the method functions, while dynamic branching iterates over the seeds. tar_map() creates new patterns as well as new commands. So below, the summary methods map over the analysis methods both statically and dynamically. # _targets.R file: library(targets) library(tarchetypes) library(tibble) random_seed &lt;- tar_target(random_seed, seq_len(10)) targets &lt;- tar_map( values = tibble(method_function = rlang::syms(c(&quot;method1&quot;, &quot;method2&quot;))), tar_target( analysis, method_function(&quot;NIH&quot;, seed = random_seed), pattern = map(random_seed) ), tar_target( summary, summarize_analysis(analysis), pattern = map(analysis) ) ) tar_pipeline(random_seed, targets) tar_manifest() #&gt; # A tibble: 5 x 3 #&gt; name command pattern #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 analysis_method1 &quot;method1(\\&quot;NIH\\&quot;, seed = random_seed)&quot; map(random_seed) #&gt; 2 analysis_method2 &quot;method2(\\&quot;NIH\\&quot;, seed = random_seed)&quot; map(random_seed) #&gt; 3 random_seed &quot;seq_len(10)&quot; &lt;NA&gt; #&gt; 4 summary_method1 &quot;summarize_analysis(analysis_method1)&quot; map(analysis_method1) #&gt; 5 summary_method2 &quot;summarize_analysis(analysis_method2)&quot; map(analysis_method2) tar_visnetwork(targets_only = TRUE) 6.2 Combine tar_combine() from the tarchetypes package creates a new target to aggregate the results of upstream targets. In the simple example below, our combined target simply aggregates the rows returned from two other targets. # _targets.R file: library(targets) library(tarchetypes) library(tibble) options(crayon.enabled = FALSE) target1 &lt;- tar_target(head, head(mtcars, 1)) target2 &lt;- tar_target(tail, tail(mtcars, 1)) target3 &lt;- tar_combine(combined_target, target1, target2) tar_pipeline(target1, target2, target3) tar_manifest() #&gt; # A tibble: 3 x 3 #&gt; name command pattern #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 combined_targ… vctrs::vec_c(head_mtcars = head_mtcars, tail_mtcars = … &lt;NA&gt; #&gt; 2 tail_mtcars tail(mtcars, 1) &lt;NA&gt; #&gt; 3 head_mtcars head(mtcars, 1) &lt;NA&gt; tar_visnetwork(targets_only = TRUE) tar_make() #&gt; ● run target head_mtcars #&gt; ● run target tail_mtcars #&gt; ● run target combined_target tar_read(combined_target) #&gt; mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb #&gt; Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.62 16.46 0 1 4 4 #&gt; Volvo 142E 21.4 4 121 109 4.11 2.78 18.60 1 1 4 2 To use tar_combine() and tar_map() together in more complicated situations, you may need to supply unlist = FALSE to tar_map(). That way, tar_map() will return a nested list of target objects, and you can combine the ones you want. The pipeline extends our previous tar_map() example by combining just the summaries, omitting the analyses from tar_combine(). Also note the use of bind_rows(!!!.x) below. This is how you supply custom code to combine the return values of other targets. .x is a placeholder for the return values, and !!! is the “unquote-splice” operator from the rlang package. # _targets.R file: library(targets) library(tarchetypes) library(tibble) random_seed &lt;- tar_target(random_seed, seq_len(10)) mapped &lt;- tar_map( unlist = FALSE, # Return a nested list from tar_map() values = tibble(method_function = rlang::syms(c(&quot;method1&quot;, &quot;method2&quot;))), tar_target( analysis, method_function(&quot;NIH&quot;, seed = random_seed), pattern = map(random_seed) ), tar_target( summary, summarize_analysis(analysis), pattern = map(analysis) ) ) combined &lt;- tar_combine( combined_summaries, mapped[[2]], command = dplyr::bind_rows(!!!.x, .id = &quot;method&quot;) ) tar_pipeline(random_seed, mapped, combined) tar_manifest() #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 3 #&gt; name command pattern #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 analysis_met… &quot;method1(\\&quot;NIH\\&quot;, seed = random_seed)&quot; map(random_see… #&gt; 2 analysis_met… &quot;method2(\\&quot;NIH\\&quot;, seed = random_seed)&quot; map(random_see… #&gt; 3 combined_sum… &quot;dplyr::bind_rows(summary_method1 = summary_met… &lt;NA&gt; #&gt; 4 random_seed &quot;seq_len(10)&quot; &lt;NA&gt; #&gt; 5 summary_meth… &quot;summarize_analysis(analysis_method1)&quot; map(analysis_m… #&gt; 6 summary_meth… &quot;summarize_analysis(analysis_method2)&quot; map(analysis_m… tar_visnetwork(targets_only = TRUE) 6.3 Metaprogram Custom metaprogramming is an alternative to built-in branching for large collections of targets. Metaprogramming can help you understand of the targets you start with, create informative target names, and construct complicated pipelines when layered on top of patterns. In the example below, we define a target for each data source in a mock workflow. We use tar_target_raw() instead of tar_target() to avoid the non-standard evaluation, which lets us supply target names, expressions, and pattern specifications programmatically. tar_script({ suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(purrr)) datasets &lt;- c(&quot;gapminder&quot;, &quot;who&quot;, &quot;imf&quot;) data_target_list &lt;- map( datasets, ~tar_target_raw(.x, substitute(get_data(x), env = list(x = .x))) ) tar_pipeline(data_target_list) }) tar_manifest() is especially important for checking the correctness of your metaprogramming. tar_manifest(fields = &quot;command&quot;) #&gt; # A tibble: 3 x 2 #&gt; name command #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 imf &quot;get_data(\\&quot;imf\\&quot;)&quot; #&gt; 2 gapminder &quot;get_data(\\&quot;gapminder\\&quot;)&quot; #&gt; 3 who &quot;get_data(\\&quot;who\\&quot;)&quot; We can define symbols with rlang::sym() and insert them into expressions with substitute(). It is straightforward to define entire chains of targets this way. The example below demonstrates how to work with symbols and use metaprogramming and patterns simultaneously. tar_script({ suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(purrr)) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(rlang)) target_a &lt;- tar_target(a, seq_len(2)) target_list &lt;- map( seq(2, 4), ~tar_target_raw( letters[.x], substitute(identity(y), env = list(y = sym(letters[.x - 1]))), pattern = substitute(map(y), env = list(y = sym(letters[.x - 1]))) ) ) tar_pipeline(target_a, target_list) }) library(dplyr) tar_manifest() #&gt; # A tibble: 4 x 3 #&gt; name command pattern #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 a seq_len(2) &lt;NA&gt; #&gt; 2 b identity(a) map(a) #&gt; 3 c identity(b) map(b) #&gt; 4 d identity(c) map(c) tar_glimpse() "],["hpc.html", "Chapter 7 High-performance computing 7.1 Clustermq 7.2 Future 7.3 Advanced", " Chapter 7 High-performance computing targets supports high-performance computing with the tar_make_clustermq() and tar_make_future() functions. These functions are like tar_make(), but they allow multiple targets to run simultaneously over parallel workers. These workers can be processes on your local machine, or they can be jobs on a computing cluster. The main process automatically sends a target to a worker as soon as The worker is available, and All the target’s upstream dependency targets have been checked or built. Practical real-world examples of high-performance computing in targets can be found at the examples linked from here. But for the purposes of explaining the mechanics of the package, consider the following sketch of a pipeline. tar_visnetwork() When we run this pipeline with high-performance computing, targets automatically knows to wait for data to finish running before moving on to the other targets. Once data is finished, it moves on to targets fast_fit and slow_fit. If fast_fit finishes before slow_fit, target plot_1 begins even as slow_fit is still running. Unlike drake, targets applies this behavior not only to stem targets, but also to branches of patterns. The following sections cover the mechanics and configuration details of high-performance computing in targets. 7.1 Clustermq tar_make_clustermq() uses persistent workers. That means all the parallel processes launch together as soon as there is a target to build, and all the processes keep running until the pipeline winds down. The video clip below visualizes the concept. 7.1.1 Clustermq installation Persistent workers require the clustermq R package, which in turn requires ZeroMQ. Please refer to the clustermq installation guide for specific instructions. 7.1.2 Clustermq locally When you write your _targets.R script, be sure to set the clustermq.scheduler global option to a a local scheduler like \"multicore\". Many of the supported schedulers and their configuration details are listed here. # _targets.R options(clustermq.scheduler = &quot;multicore&quot;) tar_pipeline( tar_target(data, get_data()), tar_target(fast_fit, fit_small_model(data)), tar_target(slow_fit, fit_slow_model(data)), tar_target(plot_1, make_plot(fast_fit)), tar_target(plot_2, make_plot(slow_fit)) ) Then, run tar_make_clustermq() with the appropriate number of workers. tar_make_clustermq(workers = 2) 7.1.3 Clustermq remotely For parallel computing on a cluster, Choose a scheduler listed here that corresponds to your cluster’s resource manager. Create a template file that configures the computing requirements and other settings for the cluster. Supply the scheduler option and template file to the clustermq.scheduler and clustermq.template global options in your _targets.R file. # _targets.R options(clustermq.scheduler = &quot;sge&quot;, clustermq.template = &quot;sge.tmpl&quot;) tar_pipeline( tar_target(data, get_data()), tar_target(fast_fit, fit_small_model(data)), tar_target(slow_fit, fit_slow_model(data)), tar_target(plot_1, make_plot(fast_fit)), tar_target(plot_2, make_plot(slow_fit)) ) Above, sge_tmpl refers to a template file like the one below. ## From https://github.com/mschubert/clustermq/wiki/SGE #$ -N {{ job_name }} # Worker name. #$ -t 1-{{ n_jobs }} # Submit workers as an array. #$ -j y # Combine stdout and stderr into one worker log file. #$ -o /dev/null # Worker log files. #$ -cwd # Use project root as working directory. #$ -V # Use environment variables. module load R/3.6.3 # Needed if R is an environment module on the cluster. CMQ_AUTH={{ auth }} R --no-save --no-restore -e &#39;clustermq:::worker(&quot;{{ main }}&quot;)&#39; # Leave alone. Then, run tar_make_clustermq() as before. tar_make_clustermq(workers = 2) See the examples linked from here to see how this setup works in real-world projects. 7.1.4 Clustermq configuration In addition to configuration options hard-coded in the template file, you can supply custom computing resources with the resources argument of tar_option_set(). As an example, let’s use a wildcard for the number of cores per worker on an SGE cluster. In the template file, supply {{ num_cores }} wildcard to the -pe smp flag. #$ -pe smp {{ num_cores }} # Number of cores per worker #$ -N {{ job_name | 1 }} #$ -t 1-{{ n_jobs }} #$ -j y #$ -o /dev/null #$ -cwd #$ -V module load R/3.6.3 CMQ_AUTH={{ auth }} R --no-save --no-restore -e &#39;clustermq:::worker(&quot;{{ main }}&quot;)&#39; Then, supply the value of num_cores to the resources option from within _targets.R. # _targets.R tar_option_set(resources = list(num_cores = 2)) tar_pipeline(...) Finally, call tar_make_clustermq() normally. tar_make_clustermq(workers = 2) This particular use case comes up when you have custom parallel computing within targets and need to take advantage of multiple cores. 7.2 Future tar_make_future() runs transient workers. That means each target gets its own worker which initializes when the target begins and terminates when the target ends. The following video clip demonstrates the concept. 7.2.1 Future installation Install the future package. install.packages(&quot;future&quot;) # CRAN release # Alternatively, install the GitHub development version. devtools::install_github(&quot;HenrikBengtsson/future&quot;, ref = &quot;develop&quot;) If you intend to use a cluster, be sure to install the future.batchtools package too. The future ecosystem contains even more packages that extend future’s parallel computing functionality, such as future.callr. 7.2.2 Future locally To parallelize targets over multiple processes on your local machine, declare one of the future plans listed here in your _targets.R file. # _targets.R library(future) plan(multisession) tar_pipeline( tar_target(data, get_data()), tar_target(fast_fit, fit_small_model(data)), tar_target(slow_fit, fit_slow_model(data)), tar_target(plot_1, make_plot(fast_fit)), tar_target(plot_2, make_plot(slow_fit)) ) Then, run tar_make_future() with the desired number of workers. Here, the workers argument specifies the maximum number of transient workers to allow at a given time. Some future plans also have optional workers arguments that set their own caps. tar_make_future(workers = 2) 7.2.3 Future remotely To run transient workers on a cluster, first install the future.batchtools package. Then, set one of these plans in your _targets.R file. # _targets.R library(future) library(future.batchtools) plan(batchtools_sge, template = &quot;sge.tmpl&quot;) tar_pipeline( tar_target(data, get_data()), tar_target(fast_fit, fit_small_model(data)), tar_target(slow_fit, fit_slow_model(data)), tar_target(plot_1, make_plot(fast_fit)), tar_target(plot_2, make_plot(slow_fit)) ) Here, our template file sge.tmpl is configured for batchtools. #!/bin/bash #$ -cwd # Run in the current working directory. #$ -j y # Direct stdout and stderr to the same file. #$ -o &lt;%= log.file %&gt; # log file #$ -V # Use environment variables. #$ -N &lt;%= job.name %&gt; # job name module load R/3.6.3 # Uncomment and adjust if R is an environment module. Rscript -e &#39;batchtools::doJobCollection(&quot;&lt;%= uri %&gt;&quot;)&#39; # Leave alone. exit 0 # Leave alone. 7.2.4 Future configuration The tar_target(), tar_target_raw(), and tar_option_set() functions accept a resources argument. For example, if our batchtools template file has a wildcard for the number of cores for a job, #!/bin/bash #$ -pe smp &lt;%= resources[[&quot;num_cores&quot;]] | 1 %&gt; # Wildcard for cores per job. #$ -cwd #$ -j y #$ -o &lt;%= log.file %&gt; #$ -V #$ -N &lt;%= job.name %&gt; module load R/3.6.3 Rscript -e &#39;batchtools::doJobCollection(&quot;&lt;%= uri %&gt;&quot;)&#39; exit 0 then you can set the number of cores for individual targets. In the case below, maybe the slow model needs 2 cores to run fast enough. # _targets.R library(future) library(future.batchtools) plan(batchtools_sge, template = &quot;sge.tmpl&quot;) tar_pipeline( tar_target(data, get_data()), tar_target(fast_fit, fit_small_model(data)), tar_target(slow_fit, fit_slow_model(data), resources = list(num_cores = 2)), tar_target(plot_1, make_plot(fast_fit)), tar_target(plot_2, make_plot(slow_fit)) ) Then, run tar_make_future() as usual. tar_make_future(workers = 2) The resources of tar_target() defaults to tar_option_get(\"resources\"). You can set the default value for all targets using tar_option_set(). 7.3 Advanced Functions tar_target(), tar_target_raw(), and tar_option_set() support advanced configuration options for heavy-duty pipelines that require high-performance computing. deployment: With the deployment argument, you can choose to run some targets locally on the main process instead of on a high-performance computing worker. This options is suitable for lightweight targets such as R Markdown reports where runtime is quick and a cluster would be excessive. memory: Choose whether to retain a target in memory or remove it from memory whenever it is not needed at the moment. This is a tradeoff between memory consumption and storage read speeds, and like all of the options listed here, you can set it on a target-by-target basis. The default settings consume a lot of memory to avoid frequently reading from storage. To keep memory usage down to a minimum, set memory = \"transient\" and garbage_collection = TRUE in tar_target() or tar_option_set(). For cloud-based dynamic files such as format = \"aws_file\", this memory policy applies to temporary local copies of the file in _targets/scratch/: \"persistent\" means they remain until the end of the pipeline, and \"transient\" means they get deleted from the file system as soon as possible. The former conserves bandwidth, and the latter conserves local storage. garbage_collection: Choose whether to run base::gc() just before running the target. storage: Choose whether the parallel workers or the main process is responsible for saving the target’s value. For slow network file systems on clusters, storage = \"main\" is often faster for small numbers of targets. For large numbers of targets or low-bandwidth connections between the main and workers, storage = \"worker\" is often faster. Always choose storage = \"main\" if the workers do no have access to the file system with the _targets/ data store. retrieval: Choose whether the parallel workers or the main process is responsible for reading dependency targets from disk. Should usually be set to whatever you choose for storage (default). Always choose retrieval = \"main\" if the workers do no have access to the file system with the _targets/ data store. format: If your pipeline has large computation, it may also have large data. Consider setting the format argument to help targets store and retrieve your data faster. error: Set error to \"continue\" to let the rest of the pipeline keep running even if a target encounters an error. "],["cloud.html", "Chapter 8 Cloud integration 8.1 Compute 8.2 Storage", " Chapter 8 Cloud integration targets has built-in cloud capabilities to help scale pipelines up and out. 8.1 Compute Right now, targets does not have built-in cloud-based distributed computing support. However, future development plans include seamless integration with AWS Batch. As a temporary workaround, it is possible to deploy a burstable SLURM cluster using AWS ParallelCluster and leverage targets’ existing support for traditional schedulers. 8.2 Storage targets supports cloud storage on a target-by-target basis using Amazon Simple Storage Service, or S3. After a target completes, the return value is uploaded to a user-defined S3 bucket S3 bucket. Follow these steps to get started. 8.2.1 Get started with the Amazon S3 web console If you do not already have an Amazon Web Services account, sign up for the free tier at https://aws.amazon.com/free. Then, follow these step-by-step instructions to practice using Amazon S3 through the web console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/. 8.2.2 Configure your local machine targets uses the aws.s3 package behind the scenes. It is not a strict dependency of targets, so you will need to install it yourself. install.packages(&quot;aws.s3&quot;) Next, aws.s3 needs an access ID, secret access key, and default region. Follow these steps to generate the keys, and choose a region from this table of endpoints. Then, open the .Renviron file in your home directory with usethis::edit_r_environ() and store this information in special environment variables. Here is an example .Renviron file. # Example .Renviron file AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 Restart your R session so the changes take effect. Your keys are sensitive personal information. You can print them in your private console to verify correctness, but otherwise please avoid saving them to any persistent documents other than .Renviron. Sys.getenv(&quot;AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE&quot; Sys.getenv(&quot;AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY&quot; Sys.getenv(&quot;AWS_DEFAULT_REGION&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;us-east-1&quot; 8.2.3 Create S3 buckets Now, you are ready to create one or more S3 buckets for your targets pipeline. Each pipeline should have its own set of buckets. Create one through the web console or with aws.s3::put_bucket(). library(aws.s3) put_bucket(&quot;my-test-bucket-25edb4956460647d&quot;) #&gt; [1] TRUE Sign in to https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3 to verify that the bucket exists. 8.2.4 Configure the pipeline To connect your pipeline with S3, Supply your bucket name to resources in tar_option_set(). To use different buckets for different targets, set resources directly in tar_target(). Supply AWS-powered storage formats to tar_option_set() and/or tar_target(). See the tar_target() help file for the full list of formats. Your _targets.R file will look something like this. # Example _targets.R library(targets) tar_option_set(resources = list(bucket = &quot;my-test-bucket-25edb4956460647d&quot;)) write_mean &lt;- function(data) { tmp &lt;- tempfile() writeLines(as.character(mean(data)), tmp) tmp } tar_pipeline( tar_target(data, rnorm(5), format = &quot;aws_qs&quot;), tar_target(mean_file, write_mean(data), format = &quot;aws_file&quot;) ) 8.2.5 Run the pipeline When you run the pipeline above with tar_make(), your local R session computes rnorm(5), saves it to a temporary qs file on disk, and then uploads it to a file called _targets/objects/data on your S3 bucket. Likewise for mean_file, but because the format is \"aws_file\", you are responsible for supplying the path to the file that gets uploaded to _targets/objects/mean_file. tar_make() #&gt; ● run target data #&gt; ● run target mean_file And of course, your targets stay up to date if you make no changes. tar_make() #&gt; ✓ skip target data #&gt; ✓ skip target mean_file #&gt; ✓ Already up to date. 8.2.6 Manage the data Log into https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3. You should see objects _targets/objects/data and _targets/objects/mean_file in your bucket. To download this data locally, use tar_read() and tar_load() like before. These functions download the data from the bucket and load it into R. tar_read(data) #&gt; [1] -0.74654607 -0.59593497 -1.57229983 0.40915323 0.02579023 The \"aws_file\" format is different from the other AWS-powered formats. tar_read() and tar_load() download the object to a temporary file and return the path so you can process it yourself.3 tar_load(mean_file) mean_file #&gt; [1] &quot;_targets/scratch/mean_fileff086e70876d&quot; readLines(mean_file) #&gt; [1] &quot;-0.495967480886693&quot; When you are done with these temporary files and the pipeline is no longer running, you can safely remove everything in _targets/scratch/. unlink(&quot;_targets/scratch/&quot;, recursive = TRUE) Lastly, if you want to erase the whole project or start over from scratch, consider removing the S3 bucket to avoid incurring storage fees. The easiest way to do this is through the S3 console. You can alternatively call aws.s3::delete_bucket(), but you have to make sure the bucket is empty first. delete_bucket(&quot;my-test-bucket-25edb4956460647d&quot;) Non-“file” AWS formats also download temporary files, but they are immediately discarded after they are read into memory.↩︎ "]]
